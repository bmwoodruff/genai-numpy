I will provide you with the docstring for the herm2poly function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.hermite.herm2poly. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Convert a Hermite series to a polynomial.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a Hermite series,
    ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an array of the coefficients
    of the equivalent polynomial (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array containing the Hermite series coefficients, ordered
        from lowest order term to highest.

    Returns
    -------
    pol : ndarray
        1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent polynomial
        (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest order term
        to highest.

    poly2herm

    Notes
    -----
    The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets
    is to use the convert method of a class instance.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import herm2poly
    >>> herm2poly([ 1.   ,  2.75 ,  0.5  ,  0.375])
    array([0., 1., 2., 3.])

    Converting a Hermite series with negative coefficients:
    
    >>> np.polynomial.hermite.herm2poly([-1. , -2.75, -0.5, -0.375])
    array([0., -1., -2., -3.])
