I will provide you with the docstring for the trace function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.linalg.trace. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Returns the sum along the specified diagonals of a matrix
    (or a stack of matrices) ``x``.

    This function is Array API compatible, contrary to
    :py:func:`numpy.trace`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (...,M,N) array_like
        Input array having shape (..., M, N) and whose innermost two
        dimensions form MxN matrices.
    offset : int, optional
        Offset specifying the off-diagonal relative to the main diagonal,
        where::

            * offset = 0: the main diagonal.
            * offset > 0: off-diagonal above the main diagonal.
            * offset < 0: off-diagonal below the main diagonal.

    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data type of the returned array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        An array containing the traces and whose shape is determined by
        removing the last two dimensions and storing the traces in the last
        array dimension. For example, if x has rank k and shape:
        (I, J, K, ..., L, M, N), then an output array has rank k-2 and shape:
        (I, J, K, ..., L) where::

            out[i, j, k, ..., l] = trace(a[i, j, k, ..., l, :, :])

        The returned array must have a data type as described by the dtype
        parameter above.

Here is the updated docstring with additional examples:

    (or a stack of matrices) ``x``.

    offset : int, optional
        Offset specifying the off-diagonal relative to the main diagonal,

            * offset = 0: the main diagonal.
            * offset > 0: off-diagonal above the main diagonal.
            * offset < 0: off-diagonal below the main diagonal.

    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data type of the returned array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        An array containing the traces and whose shape is determined by
        removing the last two dimensions and storing the traces in the last

        The returned array must have a data type as described by the dtype
        parameter above.

    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.linalg.trace(x)

    Computing the upper diagonal:
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.linalg.trace(x, offset=1)
    2

    Computing the lower diagonal:
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.linalg.trace(x, offset=-1)
    3

    Computing the trace of a stack of matrices:
    >>> x = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
    >>> np.linalg.trace(x)
    array([5, 13])
