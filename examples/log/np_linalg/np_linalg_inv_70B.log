I will provide you with the docstring for the inv function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.linalg.inv. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the inverse of a matrix.

    Given a square matrix `a`, return the matrix `ainv` satisfying
    ``a @ ainv = ainv @ a = eye(a.shape[0])``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array_like
        Matrix to be inverted.

    Returns
    -------
    ainv : (..., M, M) ndarray or matrix
        Inverse of the matrix `a`.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If `a` is not square or inversion fails.

    See Also
    --------
    scipy.linalg.inv : Similar function in SciPy.
    numpy.linalg.cond : Compute the condition number of a matrix.
    numpy.linalg.svd : Compute the singular value decomposition of a matrix.

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for
    details.

    If `a` is detected to be singular, a `LinAlgError` is raised. If `a` is
    ill-conditioned, a `LinAlgError` may or may not be raised, and results may
    be inaccurate due to floating-point errors.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.linalg import inv
    >>> a = np.array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
    >>> ainv = inv(a)
    >>> np.allclose(a @ ainv, np.eye(2))
    True
    >>> np.allclose(ainv @ a, np.eye(2))
    True

    If a is a matrix object, then the return value is a matrix as well:

    >>> ainv = inv(np.matrix(a))
    >>> ainv
    matrix([[-2. ,  1. ],
            [ 1.5, -0.5]])

    Inverses of several matrices can be computed at once:

    >>> a = np.array([[[1., 2.], [3., 4.]], [[1, 3], [3, 5]]])
    >>> inv(a)
    array([[[-2.  ,  1.  ],
            [ 1.5 , -0.5 ]],
           [[-1.25,  0.75],
            [ 0.75, -0.25]]])

    If a matrix is close to singular, the computed inverse may not satisfy
    ``a @ ainv = ainv @ a = eye(a.shape[0])`` even if a `LinAlgError`
    is not raised:

    >>> a = np.array([[2,4,6],[2,0,2],[6,8,14]])
    >>> inv(a)  # No errors raised
    array([[-1.12589991e+15, -5.62949953e+14,  5.62949953e+14],
       [-1.12589991e+15, -5.62949953e+14,  5.62949953e+14],
       [ 1.12589991e+15,  5.62949953e+14, -5.62949953e+14]])
    >>> a @ inv(a)
    array([[ 0.   , -0.5  ,  0.   ],  # may vary
           [-0.5  ,  0.625,  0.25 ],
           [ 0.   ,  0.   ,  1.   ]])

    To detect ill-conditioned matrices, you can use `numpy.linalg.cond` to
    compute its *condition number* [1]_. The larger the condition number, the
    more ill-conditioned the matrix is. As a rule of thumb, if the condition
    number ``cond(a) = 10**k``, then you may lose up to ``k`` digits of
    accuracy on top of what would be lost to the numerical method due to loss
    of precision from arithmetic methods.

    >>> from numpy.linalg import cond
    >>> cond(a)
    np.float64(8.659885634118668e+17)  # may vary

    It is also possible to detect ill-conditioning by inspecting the matrix's
    singular values directly. The ratio between the largest and the smallest
    singular value is the condition number:

    >>> from numpy.linalg import svd
    >>> sigma = svd(a, compute_uv=False)  # Do not compute singular vectors
    >>> sigma.max()/sigma.min()
    8.659885634118668e+17  # may vary

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.linalg import inv
    >>> a = np.array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
    >>> ainv = inv(a)
    >>> np.allclose(a @ ainv, np.eye(2))
    True
    >>> np.allclose(ainv @ a, np.eye(2))
    True

    If a is a matrix object, then the return value is a matrix as well:

    >>> ainv = inv(np.matrix(a))
    >>> ainv
    matrix([[-2. ,  1. ],
            [ 1.5, -0.5]])

    Inverses of several matrices can be computed at once:

    >>> a = np.array([[[1., 2.], [3., 4.]], [[1, 3], [3, 5]]])
    >>> inv(a)
    array([[[-2.  ,  1.  ],
            [ 1.5 , -0.5 ]],
           [[-1.25,  0.75],
            [ 0.75, -0.25]]])

    If a matrix is close to singular, the computed inverse may not satisfy
    ``a @ ainv = ainv @ a = eye(a.shape[0])`` even if a `LinAlgError`
    is not raised:

    >>> a = np.array([[2,4,6],[2,0,2],[6,8,14]])
    >>> inv(a)  # No errors raised
    array([[-1.12589991e+15, -5.62949953e+14,  5.62949953e+14],
       [-1.12589991e+15, -5.62949953e+14,  5.62949953e+14],
       [ 1.12589991e+15,  5.62949953e+14, -5.62949953e+14]])
    >>> a @ inv(a)
    array([[ 0.   , -0.5  ,  0.   ],  # may vary
           [-0.5  ,  0.625,  0.25 ],
           [ 0.   ,  0.   ,  1.   ]])

    >>> a = np.array([[1 + 2j, 3 + 4j], [5 + 6j, 7 + 8j]])
    >>> ainv = inv(a)
    >>> np.allclose(a @ ainv, np.eye(2))
    True
    >>> np.allclose(ainv @ a, np.eye(2))
    True
