I will provide you with the docstring for the solve function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.linalg.solve. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Solve a linear matrix equation, or system of linear scalar equations.

    Computes the "exact" solution, `x`, of the well-determined, i.e., full
    rank, linear matrix equation `ax = b`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array_like
        Coefficient matrix.
    b : {(M,), (..., M, K)}, array_like
        Ordinate or "dependent variable" values.

    Returns
    -------
    x : {(..., M,), (..., M, K)} ndarray
        Solution to the system a x = b.  Returned shape is (..., M) if b is
        shape (M,) and (..., M, K) if b is (..., M, K), where the "..." part is
        broadcasted between a and b.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If `a` is singular or not square.

    scipy.linalg.solve : Similar function in SciPy.

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for
    details.

    The solutions are computed using LAPACK routine ``_gesv``.

    `a` must be square and of full-rank, i.e., all rows (or, equivalently,
    columns) must be linearly independent; if either is not true, use
    `lstsq` for the least-squares best "solution" of the
    system/equation.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0

       The b array is only treated as a shape (M,) column vector if it is
       exactly 1-dimensional. In all other instances it is treated as a stack
       of (M, K) matrices. Previously b would be treated as a stack of (M,)
       vectors if b.ndim was equal to a.ndim - 1.

    Examples
    --------
    Solve the system of equations:
    ``x0 + 2 * x1 = 1`` and
    ``3 * x0 + 5 * x1 = 2``:

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 5]])
    >>> b = np.array([1, 2])
    >>> x = np.linalg.solve(a, b)
    >>> x
    array([-1.,  1.])

    Check that the solution is correct:

    >>> np.allclose(np.dot(a, x), b)
    True

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    Solve the system of equations:
    ``x0 + 2 * x1 = 1`` and
    ``3 * x0 + 5 * x1 = 2``:

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 5]])
    >>> b = np.array([1, 2])
    >>> x = np.linalg.solve(a, b)
    >>> x
    array([-1.,  1.])

    Check that the solution is correct:

    >>> np.allclose(np.dot(a, x), b)
    True

    Solve a system of linear scalar equations:

    >>> a = np.array([[3, 1], [1, 2]])
    >>> b = np.array([9, 8])
    >>> x = np.linalg.solve(a, b)
    >>> x
    array([2., 3.])

I decided to add an example because the existing examples only demonstrate solving a system of linear equations with two variables. The new example shows how to solve a system of linear scalar equations, which is a different use case. This example helps to illustrate the flexibility of the `solve` function in handling different types of linear equations.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples, along with the new one, provide a good representation of the functionality of the `solve` function. The new example covers a different scenario, and further examples would likely be redundant or too specific.
