I will provide you with the docstring for the tensorsolve function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.linalg.tensorsolve. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Solve the tensor equation ``a x = b`` for x.

    It is assumed that all indices of `x` are summed over in the product,
    together with the rightmost indices of `a`, as is done in, for example,
    ``tensordot(a, x, axes=x.ndim)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Coefficient tensor, of shape ``b.shape + Q``. `Q`, a tuple, equals
        the shape of that sub-tensor of `a` consisting of the appropriate
        number of its rightmost indices, and must be such that
        ``prod(Q) == prod(b.shape)`` (in which sense `a` is said to be
        'square').
    b : array_like
        Right-hand tensor, which can be of any shape.
    axes : tuple of ints, optional
        Axes in `a` to reorder to the right, before inversion.
        If None (default), no reordering is done.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray, shape Q

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If `a` is singular or not 'square' (in the above sense).

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.tensordot, tensorinv, numpy.einsum

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.eye(2*3*4)
    >>> a.shape = (2*3, 4, 2, 3, 4)
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> b = rng.normal(size=(2*3, 4))
    >>> x = np.linalg.tensorsolve(a, b)
    >>> x.shape
    (2, 3, 4)
    >>> np.allclose(np.tensordot(a, x, axes=3), b)
    True

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Solve the tensor equation ``a x = b`` for x.

    It is assumed that all indices of `x` are summed over in the product,
    together with the rightmost indices of `a`, as is done in, for example,
    ``tensordot(a, x, axes=x.ndim)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Coefficient tensor, of shape ``b.shape + Q``. `Q`, a tuple, equals
        the shape of that sub-tensor of `a` consisting of the appropriate
        number of its rightmost indices, and must be such that
        ``prod(Q) == prod(b.shape)`` (in which sense `a` is said to be
        'square').
    b : array_like
        Right-hand tensor, which can be of any shape.
    axes : tuple of ints, optional
        Axes in `a` to reorder to the right, before inversion.
        If None (default), no reordering is done.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray, shape Q

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If `a` is singular or not 'square' (in the above sense).

    See Also
    --------

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.eye(2*3*4)
    >>> a.shape = (2*3, 4, 2, 3, 4)
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> b = rng.normal(size=(2*3, 4))
    >>> x = np.linalg.tensorsolve(a, b)
    >>> x.shape
    (2, 3, 4)
    >>> np.allclose(np.tensordot(a, x, axes=3), b)
    True

    Reordering axes:
    >>> a = np.random.rand(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    >>> b = np.random.rand(2, 3, 5)
    >>> x = np.linalg.tensorsolve(a, b, axes=(2, 4))
    >>> x.shape
    (3, 4, 6)
    >>> np.allclose(np.tensordot(a, x, axes=3), b)
    True
