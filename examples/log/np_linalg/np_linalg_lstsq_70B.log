I will provide you with the docstring for the lstsq function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.linalg.lstsq. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation.

    Computes the vector `x` that approximately solves the equation
    ``a @ x = b``. The equation may be under-, well-, or over-determined
    (i.e., the number of linearly independent rows of `a` can be less than,
    equal to, or greater than its number of linearly independent columns).
    If `a` is square and of full rank, then `x` (but for round-off error)
    is the "exact" solution of the equation. Else, `x` minimizes the
    Euclidean 2-norm :math:`||b - ax||`. If there are multiple minimizing
    solutions, the one with the smallest 2-norm :math:`||x||` is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (M, N) array_like
        "Coefficient" matrix.
    b : {(M,), (M, K)} array_like
        Ordinate or "dependent variable" values. If `b` is two-dimensional,
        the least-squares solution is calculated for each of the `K` columns
        of `b`.
    rcond : float, optional
        Cut-off ratio for small singular values of `a`.
        For the purposes of rank determination, singular values are treated
        as zero if they are smaller than `rcond` times the largest singular
        value of `a`.
        The default uses the machine precision times ``max(M, N)``.  Passing
        ``-1`` will use machine precision.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0
            Previously, the default was ``-1``, but a warning was given that
            this would change.

    Returns
    -------
    x : {(N,), (N, K)} ndarray
        Least-squares solution. If `b` is two-dimensional,
        the solutions are in the `K` columns of `x`.
    residuals : {(1,), (K,), (0,)} ndarray
        Sums of squared residuals: Squared Euclidean 2-norm for each column in
        ``b - a @ x``.
        If the rank of `a` is < N or M <= N, this is an empty array.
        If `b` is 1-dimensional, this is a (1,) shape array.
        Otherwise the shape is (K,).
    rank : int
        Rank of matrix `a`.
    s : (min(M, N),) ndarray
        Singular values of `a`.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If computation does not converge.

    See Also
    --------
    scipy.linalg.lstsq : Similar function in SciPy.

    Notes
    -----
    If `b` is a matrix, then all array results are returned as matrices.

    Examples
    --------
    Fit a line, ``y = mx + c``, through some noisy data-points:

    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = np.array([-1, 0.2, 0.9, 2.1])

    By examining the coefficients, we see that the line should have a
    gradient of roughly 1 and cut the y-axis at, more or less, -1.

    We can rewrite the line equation as ``y = Ap``, where ``A = [[x 1]]``
    and ``p = [[m], [c]]``.  Now use `lstsq` to solve for `p`:

    >>> A = np.vstack([x, np.ones(len(x))]).T
    >>> A
    array([[ 0.,  1.],
           [ 1.,  1.],
           [ 2.,  1.],
           [ 3.,  1.]])

    >>> m, c = np.linalg.lstsq(A, y)[0]
    >>> m, c
    (1.0 -0.95) # may vary

    Plot the data along with the fitted line:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> _ = plt.plot(x, y, 'o', label='Original data', markersize=10)
    >>> _ = plt.plot(x, m*x + c, 'r', label='Fitted line')
    >>> _ = plt.legend()
    >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    Fit a line, ``y = mx + c``, through some noisy data-points:

    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = np.array([-1, 0.2, 0.9, 2.1])

    By examining the coefficients, we see that the line should have a
    gradient of roughly 1 and cut the y-axis at, more or less, -1.

    We can rewrite the line equation as ``y = Ap``, where ``A = [[x 1]]``
    and ``p = [[m], [c]]``.  Now use `lstsq` to solve for `p`:

    >>> A = np.vstack([x, np.ones(len(x))]).T
    >>> A
    array([[ 0.,  1.],
           [ 1.,  1.],
           [ 2.,  1.],
           [ 3.,  1.]])

    >>> m, c = np.linalg.lstsq(A, y)[0]
    >>> m, c
    (1.0 -0.95) # may vary

    Plot the data along with the fitted line:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> _ = plt.plot(x, y, 'o', label='Original data', markersize=10)
    >>> _ = plt.plot(x, m*x + c, 'r', label='Fitted line')
    >>> _ = plt.legend()
    >>> plt.show()

    Solving an over-determined system:

    >>> A = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]])
    >>> b = np.array([1, 2, 3])

    >>> x, residuals, rank, s = np.linalg.lstsq(A, b)
    >>> x
    array([ 1.,  1.])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how to use `lstsq` to solve an over-determined system, which is a common use case for this function. This example shows how to create a coefficient matrix `A` and an ordinate array `b`, and then use `lstsq` to solve for the least-squares solution `x`. This example complements the existing example, which demonstrates how to use `lstsq` to fit a line to noisy data points.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic usage of `lstsq`, and the new example provides additional context for solving an over-determined system. Further examples may be redundant or unnecessary, and may not provide significant additional value to users.
