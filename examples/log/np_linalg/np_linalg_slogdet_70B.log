I will provide you with the docstring for the slogdet function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.linalg.slogdet. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the sign and (natural) logarithm of the determinant of an array.

    If an array has a very small or very large determinant, then a call to
    `det` may overflow or underflow. This routine is more robust against such
    issues, because it computes the logarithm of the determinant rather than
    the determinant itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array_like
        Input array, has to be a square 2-D array.

    Returns
    -------
    A namedtuple with the following attributes:

    sign : (...) array_like
        A number representing the sign of the determinant. For a real matrix,
        this is 1, 0, or -1. For a complex matrix, this is a complex number
        with absolute value 1 (i.e., it is on the unit circle), or else 0.
    logabsdet : (...) array_like
        The natural log of the absolute value of the determinant.

    If the determinant is zero, then `sign` will be 0 and `logabsdet`
    will be -inf. In all cases, the determinant is equal to
    ``sign * np.exp(logabsdet)``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for
    details.

    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    The determinant is computed via LU factorization using the LAPACK
    routine ``z/dgetrf``.


    Examples
    --------
    The determinant of a 2-D array ``[[a, b], [c, d]]`` is ``ad - bc``:

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> (sign, logabsdet) = np.linalg.slogdet(a)
    >>> (sign, logabsdet)
    (-1, 0.69314718055994529) # may vary
    >>> sign * np.exp(logabsdet)
    -2.0

    Computing log-determinants for a stack of matrices:

    >>> a = np.array([ [[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[1, 3], [3, 1]] ])
    >>> a.shape
    (3, 2, 2)
    >>> sign, logabsdet = np.linalg.slogdet(a)
    >>> (sign, logabsdet)
    (array([-1., -1., -1.]), array([ 0.69314718,  1.09861229,  2.07944154]))
    >>> sign * np.exp(logabsdet)
    array([-2., -3., -8.])

    This routine succeeds where ordinary `det` does not:

    >>> np.linalg.det(np.eye(500) * 0.1)
    0.0
    >>> np.linalg.slogdet(np.eye(500) * 0.1)
    (1, -1151.2925464970228)

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    The determinant of a 2-D array ``[[a, b], [c, d]]`` is ``ad - bc``:

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> (sign, logabsdet) = np.linalg.slogdet(a)
    >>> (sign, logabsdet)
    (-1, 0.69314718055994529) # may vary
    >>> sign * np.exp(logabsdet)
    -2.0

    Computing log-determinants for a stack of matrices:

    >>> a = np.array([ [[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[1, 3], [3, 1]] ])

    (3, 2, 2)
    >>> sign, logabsdet = np.linalg.slogdet(a)
    >>> (sign, logabsdet)

    This routine succeeds where ordinary `det` does not:

    0.0
    >>> np.linalg.slogdet(np.eye(500) * 0.1)

    Log-determinant of a complex matrix:

    >>> a = np.array([[1 + 1j, 2 + 2j], [3 + 3j, 4 + 4j]])
    >>> (sign, logabsdet) = np.linalg.slogdet(a)
    >>> (sign, logabsdet)
