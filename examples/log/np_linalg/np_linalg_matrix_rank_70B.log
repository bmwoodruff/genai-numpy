I will provide you with the docstring for the matrix_rank function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.linalg.matrix_rank. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return matrix rank of array using SVD method

    Rank of the array is the number of singular values of the array that are
    greater than `tol`.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.14
       Can now operate on stacks of matrices

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : {(M,), (..., M, N)} array_like
        Input vector or stack of matrices.
    tol : (...) array_like, float, optional
        Threshold below which SVD values are considered zero. If `tol` is
        None, and ``S`` is an array with singular values for `M`, and
        ``eps`` is the epsilon value for datatype of ``S``, then `tol` is
        set to ``S.max() * max(M, N) * eps``.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.14
           Broadcasted against the stack of matrices
    hermitian : bool, optional
        If True, `A` is assumed to be Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued),
        enabling a more efficient method for finding singular values.
        Defaults to False.

        .. versionadded:: 1.14
    rtol : (...) array_like, float, optional
        Parameter for the relative tolerance component. Only ``tol`` or
        ``rtol`` can be set at a time. Defaults to ``max(M, N) * eps``.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    rank : (...) array_like
        Rank of A.

    Notes
    -----
    The default threshold to detect rank deficiency is a test on the magnitude
    of the singular values of `A`.  By default, we identify singular values
    less than ``S.max() * max(M, N) * eps`` as indicating rank deficiency
    (with the symbols defined above). This is the algorithm MATLAB uses [1].
    It also appears in *Numerical recipes* in the discussion of SVD solutions
    for linear least squares [2].

    This default threshold is designed to detect rank deficiency accounting
    for the numerical errors of the SVD computation. Imagine that there
    is a column in `A` that is an exact (in floating point) linear combination
    of other columns in `A`. Computing the SVD on `A` will not produce
    a singular value exactly equal to 0 in general: any difference of
    the smallest SVD value from 0 will be caused by numerical imprecision
    in the calculation of the SVD. Our threshold for small SVD values takes
    this numerical imprecision into account, and the default threshold will
    detect such numerical rank deficiency. The threshold may declare a matrix
    `A` rank deficient even if the linear combination of some columns of `A`
    is not exactly equal to another column of `A` but only numerically very
    close to another column of `A`.

    We chose our default threshold because it is in wide use. Other thresholds
    are possible.  For example, elsewhere in the 2007 edition of *Numerical
    recipes* there is an alternative threshold of ``S.max() *
    np.finfo(A.dtype).eps / 2. * np.sqrt(m + n + 1.)``. The authors describe
    this threshold as being based on "expected roundoff error" (p 71).

    The thresholds above deal with floating point roundoff error in the
    calculation of the SVD.  However, you may have more information about
    the sources of error in `A` that would make you consider other tolerance
    values to detect *effective* rank deficiency. The most useful measure
    of the tolerance depends on the operations you intend to use on your
    matrix. For example, if your data come from uncertain measurements with
    uncertainties greater than floating point epsilon, choosing a tolerance
    near that uncertainty may be preferable. The tolerance may be absolute
    if the uncertainties are absolute rather than relative.
