I will provide you with the docstring for the eigvals function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.linalg.eigvals. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the eigenvalues of a general matrix.

    Main difference between `eigvals` and `eig`: the eigenvectors aren't
    returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) array_like
        A complex- or real-valued matrix whose eigenvalues will be computed.

    Returns
    -------
    w : (..., M,) ndarray
        The eigenvalues, each repeated according to its multiplicity.
        They are not necessarily ordered, nor are they necessarily
        real for real matrices.

    Raises
    ------
    LinAlgError
        If the eigenvalue computation does not converge.

    See Also
    --------
    eig : eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of general arrays
    eigvalsh : eigenvalues of real symmetric or complex Hermitian
               (conjugate symmetric) arrays.
    eigh : eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real symmetric or complex
           Hermitian (conjugate symmetric) arrays.
    scipy.linalg.eigvals : Similar function in SciPy.

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for
    details.

    This is implemented using the ``_geev`` LAPACK routines which compute
    the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general square arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    Illustration, using the fact that the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix
    are its diagonal elements, that multiplying a matrix on the left
    by an orthogonal matrix, `Q`, and on the right by `Q.T` (the transpose
    of `Q`), preserves the eigenvalues of the "middle" matrix. In other words,
    if `Q` is orthogonal, then ``Q * A * Q.T`` has the same eigenvalues as
    ``A``:

    >>> from numpy import linalg as LA
    >>> x = np.random.random()
    >>> Q = np.array([[np.cos(x), -np.sin(x)], [np.sin(x), np.cos(x)]])
    >>> LA.norm(Q[0, :]), LA.norm(Q[1, :]), np.dot(Q[0, :],Q[1, :])
    (1.0, 1.0, 0.0)

    Now multiply a diagonal matrix by ``Q`` on one side and
    by ``Q.T`` on the other:

    >>> D = np.diag((-1,1))
    >>> LA.eigvals(D)
    array([-1.,  1.])
    >>> A = np.dot(Q, D)
    >>> A = np.dot(A, Q.T)
    >>> LA.eigvals(A)
    array([ 1., -1.]) # random
