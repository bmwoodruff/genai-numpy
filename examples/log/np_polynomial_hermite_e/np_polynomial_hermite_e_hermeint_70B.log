I will provide you with the docstring for the hermeint function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.hermite_e.hermeint. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Integrate a Hermite_e series.

    Returns the Hermite_e series coefficients `c` integrated `m` times from
    `lbnd` along `axis`. At each iteration the resulting series is
    **multiplied** by `scl` and an integration constant, `k`, is added.
    The scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable.  ("Buyer
    beware": note that, depending on what one is doing, one may want `scl`
    to be the reciprocal of what one might expect; for more information,
    see the Notes section below.)  The argument `c` is an array of
    coefficients from low to high degree along each axis, e.g., [1,2,3]
    represents the series ``H_0 + 2*H_1 + 3*H_2`` while [[1,2],[1,2]]
    represents ``1*H_0(x)*H_0(y) + 1*H_1(x)*H_0(y) + 2*H_0(x)*H_1(y) +
    2*H_1(x)*H_1(y)`` if axis=0 is ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of Hermite_e series coefficients. If c is multidimensional
        the different axis correspond to different variables with the
        degree in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Order of integration, must be positive. (Default: 1)
    k : {[], list, scalar}, optional
        Integration constant(s).  The value of the first integral at
        ``lbnd`` is the first value in the list, the value of the second
        integral at ``lbnd`` is the second value, etc.  If ``k == []`` (the
        default), all constants are set to zero.  If ``m == 1``, a single
        scalar can be given instead of a list.
    lbnd : scalar, optional
        The lower bound of the integral. (Default: 0)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Following each integration the result is *multiplied* by `scl`
        before the integration constant is added. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the integral is taken. (Default: 0).

    Returns
    -------
    S : ndarray
        Hermite_e series coefficients of the integral.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``m < 0``, ``len(k) > m``, ``np.ndim(lbnd) != 0``, or
        ``np.ndim(scl) != 0``.

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the result of each integration is *multiplied* by `scl`.
    Why is this important to note?  Say one is making a linear change of
    variable :math:`u = ax + b` in an integral relative to `x`.  Then
    :math:`dx = du/a`, so one will need to set `scl` equal to
    :math:`1/a` - perhaps not what one would have first thought.

    Also note that, in general, the result of integrating a C-series needs
    to be "reprojected" onto the C-series basis set.  Thus, typically,
    the result of this function is "unintuitive," albeit correct; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermeint
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3]) # integrate once, value 0 at 0.
    array([1., 1., 1., 1.])
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], m=2) # integrate twice, value & deriv 0 at 0
    array([-0.25      ,  1.        ,  0.5       ,  0.33333333,  0.25      ]) # may vary
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], k=1) # integrate once, value 1 at 0.
    array([2., 1., 1., 1.])
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], lbnd=-1) # integrate once, value 0 at -1
    array([-1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], m=2, k=[1, 2], lbnd=-1)
    array([ 1.83333333,  0.        ,  0.5       ,  0.33333333,  0.25      ]) # may vary

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermeint
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3]) # integrate once, value 0 at 0.
    array([1., 1., 1., 1.])
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], m=2) # integrate twice, value & deriv 0 at 0
    array([-0.25      ,  1.        ,  0.5       ,  0.33333333,  0.25      ]) # may vary
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], k=1) # integrate once, value 1 at 0.
    array([2., 1., 1., 1.])
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], lbnd=-1) # integrate once, value 0 at -1
    array([-1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], m=2, k=[1, 2], lbnd=-1)
    array([ 1.83333333,  0.        ,  0.5       ,  0.33333333,  0.25      ]) # may vary
    Effect of scaling: 
    >>> hermeint([1, 2, 3], scl=2) # integrate once, value 0 at 0, scaled by 2.
    array([2., 2., 2., 2.])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the effect of the `scl` parameter, which is an important aspect of the function. This example shows how the result of the integration changes when `scl` is set to a value other than the default of 1.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a variety of use cases, including different values of `m`, `k`, `lbnd`, and combinations of these parameters. The additional example I provided helps to clarify the behavior of the `scl` parameter, which is mentioned in the Notes section but not explicitly demonstrated in the original examples.
