I will provide you with the docstring for the hermemulx function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.hermite_e.hermemulx. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Multiply a Hermite series by x.

    Multiply the Hermite series `c` by x, where x is the independent
    variable.


    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the result of the multiplication.

    Notes
    -----
    The multiplication uses the recursion relationship for Hermite
    polynomials in the form

    .. math::

        xP_i(x) = (P_{i + 1}(x) + iP_{i - 1}(x)))

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermemulx
    >>> hermemulx([1, 2, 3])
    array([2.,  7.,  2.,  3.])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Multiply a Hermite series by x.

    Multiply the Hermite series `c` by x, where x is the independent
    variable.


    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the result of the multiplication.

    Notes
    -----
    The multiplication uses the recursion relationship for Hermite
    polynomials in the form

    .. math::

        xP_i(x) = (P_{i + 1}(x) + iP_{i - 1}(x)))

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermemulx
    >>> hermemulx([1, 2, 3])
    array([2.,  7.,  2.,  3.])

    Multiplying a Hermite series with a single coefficient:
    
    >>> hermemulx([4])
