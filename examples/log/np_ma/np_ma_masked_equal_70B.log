I will provide you with the docstring for the masked_equal function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.masked_equal. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Mask an array where equal to a given value.

    Return a MaskedArray, masked where the data in array `x` are
    equal to `value`. The fill_value of the returned MaskedArray
    is set to `value`.

    For floating point arrays, consider using ``masked_values(x, value)``.

    See Also
    --------
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.
    masked_values : Mask using floating point equality.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> a = np.arange(4)
    >>> a
    array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> ma.masked_equal(a, 2)
    masked_array(data=[0, 1, --, 3],
                 mask=[False, False,  True, False],
           fill_value=2)

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Mask an array where equal to a given value.

    Return a MaskedArray, masked where the data in array `x` are
    equal to `value`. The fill_value of the returned MaskedArray
    is set to `value`.

    For floating point arrays, consider using ``masked_values(x, value)``.

    See Also
    --------
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.
    >>> masked_values : Mask using floating point equality.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> a = np.arange(4)
    >>> a
    array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> ma.masked_equal(a, 2)
    masked_array(data=[0, 1, --, 3],
                 mask=[False, False,  True, False],
           fill_value=2)

    Masking multiple values:
    
    >>> b = np.array([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5])
    >>> ma.masked_equal(b, 4)
    masked_array(data=[1, 2, 2, 3, --, --, 5],
                 mask=[False, False, False, False,  True,  True, False],
           fill_value=4)


I decided to add an example to show how `masked_equal` can be used to mask multiple occurrences of a value in an array. This example demonstrates that the function can handle arrays with multiple equal values, not just a single occurrence.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic functionality of `masked_equal`, and the additional example I added shows a slightly more complex use case. I believe these two examples are sufficient to illustrate how to use `masked_equal` effectively.
