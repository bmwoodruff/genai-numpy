I will provide you with the docstring for the filled function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.filled. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return input as an `~numpy.ndarray`, with masked values replaced by
    `fill_value`.

    If `a` is not a `MaskedArray`, `a` itself is returned.
    If `a` is a `MaskedArray` with no masked values, then ``a.data`` is
    returned.
    If `a` is a `MaskedArray` and `fill_value` is None, `fill_value` is set to
    ``a.fill_value``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : MaskedArray or array_like
        An input object.
    fill_value : array_like, optional.
        Can be scalar or non-scalar. If non-scalar, the
        resulting filled array should be broadcastable
        over input array. Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    a : ndarray
        The filled array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> x = ma.array(np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3), mask=[[1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                [1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> x.filled()
    array([[999999,      1,      2],
           [999999,      4,      5],
           [     6,      7,      8]])
    >>> x.filled(fill_value=333)
    array([[333,   1,   2],
           [333,   4,   5],
           [  6,   7,   8]])
    >>> x.filled(fill_value=np.arange(3))
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [0, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return input as an `~numpy.ndarray`, with masked values replaced by
    `fill_value`.

    If `a` is not a `MaskedArray`, `a` itself is returned.
    If `a` is a `MaskedArray` with no masked values, then ``a.data`` is
    returned.
    If `a` is a `MaskedArray` and `fill_value` is None, `fill_value` is set to
    ``a.fill_value``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : MaskedArray or array_like
        An input object.
    fill_value : array_like, optional.
        Can be scalar or non-scalar. If non-scalar, the
        resulting filled array should be broadcastable
        over input array. Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    a : ndarray
        The filled array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> x = ma.array(np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3), mask=[[1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                [1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> x.filled()
    array([[999999,      1,      2],
           [999999,      4,      5],
           [     6,      7,      8]])
    >>> x.filled(fill_value=333)
    array([[333,   1,   2],
           [333,   4,   5],
           [  6,   7,   8]])
    >>> x.filled(fill_value=np.arange(3))
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [0, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])
    Filling with a scalar value when the mask is empty:
    
    >>> y = ma.array(np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3))
    >>> np.ma.filled(y, fill_value=0)
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only show the case where the mask is not empty. This new example demonstrates the behavior of `np.ma.filled` when the mask is empty, which is an important edge case.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of `np.ma.filled`, and the new example I added covers an important edge case. Adding more examples would likely be redundant and not provide additional clarity.
