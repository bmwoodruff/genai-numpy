I will provide you with the docstring for the median function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.median. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the median along the specified axis.

    Returns the median of the array elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the medians are computed. The default (None) is
        to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow use of memory of input array (a) for
        calculations. The input array will be modified by the call to
        median. This will save memory when you do not need to preserve
        the contents of the input array. Treat the input as undefined,
        but it will probably be fully or partially sorted. Default is
        False. Note that, if `overwrite_input` is True, and the input
        is not already an `ndarray`, an error will be raised.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

    Returns
    -------
    median : ndarray
        A new array holding the result is returned unless out is
        specified, in which case a reference to out is returned.
        Return data-type is `float64` for integers and floats smaller than
        `float64`, or the input data-type, otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` with ``N`` non masked values, the median of ``V``
    is the middle value of a sorted copy of ``V`` (``Vs``) - i.e.
    ``Vs[(N-1)/2]``, when ``N`` is odd, or ``{Vs[N/2 - 1] + Vs[N/2]}/2``
    when ``N`` is even.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(8), mask=[0]*4 + [1]*4)
    >>> np.ma.median(x)
    1.5

    >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(10).reshape(2, 5), mask=[0]*6 + [1]*4)
    >>> np.ma.median(x)
    2.5
    >>> np.ma.median(x, axis=-1, overwrite_input=True)
    masked_array(data=[2.0, 5.0],
                 mask=[False, False],
           fill_value=1e+20)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(8), mask=[0]*4 + [1]*4)
    >>> np.ma.median(x)
    1.5

    >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(10).reshape(2, 5), mask=[0]*6 + [1]*4)
    >>> np.ma.median(x)
    2.5
    >>> np.ma.median(x, axis=-1, overwrite_input=True)
    masked_array(data=[2.0, 5.0],
                 mask=[False, False],
           fill_value=1e+20)

    Computing median along a specific axis:
    
    >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4), mask=[0]*8 + [1]*4)
    >>> np.ma.median(x, axis=0)
    masked_array(data=[2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0],
                 mask=[False, False, False, False],
           fill_value=1e+20)

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `axis` parameter to compute the median along a specific axis. This example shows how to compute the median along the first axis (axis=0) of a 2D array.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the `median` function, and the new example provides additional information about how to use the `axis` parameter.
