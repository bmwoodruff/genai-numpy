I will provide you with the docstring for the compress_nd function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.compress_nd. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Suppress slices from multiple dimensions which contain masked values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, MaskedArray
        The array to operate on. If not a MaskedArray instance (or if no array
        elements are masked), `x` is interpreted as a MaskedArray with `mask`
        set to `nomask`.
    axis : tuple of ints or int, optional
        Which dimensions to suppress slices from can be configured with this
        parameter.
        - If axis is a tuple of ints, those are the axes to suppress slices from.
        - If axis is an int, then that is the only axis to suppress slices from.
        - If axis is None, all axis are selected.

    Returns
    -------
    compress_array : ndarray
        The compressed array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> mask = [[0, 1], [0, 0]]
    >>> x = np.ma.array(arr, mask=mask)
    >>> np.ma.compress_nd(x, axis=0)
    array([[3, 4]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_nd(x, axis=1)
    array([[1],
           [3]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_nd(x)
    array([[3]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> mask = [[0, 1], [0, 0]]
    >>> x = np.ma.array(arr, mask=mask)
    >>> np.ma.compress_nd(x, axis=0)
    array([[3, 4]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_nd(x, axis=1)
    array([[1],
           [3]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_nd(x)
    array([[3]])
    Suppressing slices from multiple axes:
    
    >>> arr = [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]
    >>> mask = [[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]]
    >>> x = np.ma.array(arr, mask=mask)
    >>> np.ma.compress_nd(x, axis=(0, 2))
    array([[[7, 8, 9]]])

I decided to add this example because it demonstrates how to use the `axis` parameter to suppress slices from multiple dimensions. This is an important use case for the `compress_nd` function, and the existing examples did not cover it.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the function, and the new example I added covers a more advanced use case. Adding more examples would likely be redundant or cover edge cases that are not commonly encountered.
