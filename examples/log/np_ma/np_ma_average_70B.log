I will provide you with the docstring for the average function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.average. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the weighted average of array over the given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Data to be averaged.
        Masked entries are not taken into account in the computation.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to average `a`.  The default,
        `axis=None`, will average over all of the elements of the input array.
        If axis is a tuple of ints, averaging is performed on all of the axes
        specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
        before.
    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each value in
        `a` contributes to the average according to its associated weight.
        The array of weights must be the same shape as `a` if no axis is
        specified, otherwise the weights must have dimensions and shape
        consistent with `a` along the specified axis.
        If `weights=None`, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a
        weight equal to one.
        The calculation is::

            avg = sum(a * weights) / sum(weights)

        where the sum is over all included elements.
        The only constraint on the values of `weights` is that `sum(weights)`
        must not be 0.
    returned : bool, optional
        Flag indicating whether a tuple ``(result, sum of weights)``
        should be returned as output (True), or just the result (False).
        Default is False.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.
        *Note:* `keepdims` will not work with instances of `numpy.matrix`
        or other classes whose methods do not support `keepdims`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.23.0

    Returns
    -------
    average, [sum_of_weights] : (tuple of) scalar or MaskedArray
        The average along the specified axis. When returned is `True`,
        return a tuple with the average as the first element and the sum
        of the weights as the second element. The return type is `np.float64`
        if `a` is of integer type and floats smaller than `float64`, or the
        input data-type, otherwise. If returned, `sum_of_weights` is always
        `float64`.

    Raises
    ------
    ZeroDivisionError
        When all weights along axis are zero. See `numpy.ma.average` for a
        version robust to this type of error.
    TypeError
        When `weights` does not have the same shape as `a`, and `axis=None`.
    ValueError
        When `weights` does not have dimensions and shape consistent with `a`
        along specified `axis`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.ma.array([1., 2., 3., 4.], mask=[False, False, True, True])
    >>> np.ma.average(a, weights=[3, 1, 0, 0])
    1.25

    >>> x = np.ma.arange(6.).reshape(3, 2)
    >>> x
    masked_array(
      data=[[0., 1.],
            [2., 3.],
            [4., 5.]],
      mask=False,
      fill_value=1e+20)
    >>> data = np.arange(8).reshape((2, 2, 2))
    >>> data
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],
           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])
    >>> np.ma.average(data, axis=(0, 1), weights=[[1./4, 3./4], [1., 1./2]])
    masked_array(data=[3.4, 4.4],
             mask=[False, False],
       fill_value=1e+20)
    >>> np.ma.average(data, axis=0, weights=[[1./4, 3./4], [1., 1./2]])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Shape of weights must be consistent
    with shape of a along specified axis.

    >>> avg, sumweights = np.ma.average(x, axis=0, weights=[1, 2, 3],
    ...                                 returned=True)
    >>> avg
    masked_array(data=[2.6666666666666665, 3.6666666666666665],
                 mask=[False, False],
           fill_value=1e+20)

    With ``keepdims=True``, the following result has shape (3, 1).

    >>> np.ma.average(x, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    masked_array(
      data=[[0.5],
            [2.5],
            [4.5]],
      mask=False,
      fill_value=1e+20)
