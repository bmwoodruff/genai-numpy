I will provide you with the docstring for the ediff1d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.ediff1d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the differences between consecutive elements of an array.

    This function is the equivalent of `numpy.ediff1d` that takes masked
    values into account, see `numpy.ediff1d` for details.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Compute the differences between consecutive elements of an array.

    This function is the equivalent of `numpy.ediff1d` that takes masked
    values into account, see `numpy.ediff1d` for details.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.ediff1d : Equivalent function for ndarrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = np.ma.array([1, 2, 4, 7, 0])
    >>> np.ma.ediff1d(arr)
    masked_array(data=[ 1,  2,  3, -7],
                 mask=False,
           fill_value=999999)

    Handling masked values:
    
    >>> arr = np.ma.array([1, 2, 4, 7, 0], mask=[0, 0, 1, 0, 0])
    >>> np.ma.ediff1d(arr)
    masked_array(data=[ 1,  2, --, -7],
                 mask=[False, False,  True, False],
           fill_value=999999)
