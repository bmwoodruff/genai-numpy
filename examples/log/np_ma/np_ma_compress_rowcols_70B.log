I will provide you with the docstring for the compress_rowcols function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.compress_rowcols. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Suppress the rows and/or columns of a 2-D array that contain
    masked values.

    The suppression behavior is selected with the `axis` parameter.

    - If axis is None, both rows and columns are suppressed.
    - If axis is 0, only rows are suppressed.
    - If axis is 1 or -1, only columns are suppressed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, MaskedArray
        The array to operate on.  If not a MaskedArray instance (or if no array
        elements are masked), `x` is interpreted as a MaskedArray with
        `mask` set to `nomask`. Must be a 2D array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to perform the operation. Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    compressed_array : ndarray
        The compressed array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3), mask=[[1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                   [1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                   [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> x
    masked_array(
      data=[[--, 1, 2],
            [--, 4, 5],
            [6, 7, 8]],
      mask=[[ True, False, False],
            [ True, False, False],
            [False, False, False]],
      fill_value=999999)

    >>> np.ma.compress_rowcols(x)
    array([[7, 8]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_rowcols(x, 0)
    array([[6, 7, 8]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_rowcols(x, 1)
    array([[1, 2],
           [4, 5],
           [7, 8]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Suppress the rows and/or columns of a 2-D array that contain
    masked values.

    The suppression behavior is selected with the `axis` parameter.

    - If axis is None, both rows and columns are suppressed.
    - If axis is 0, only rows are suppressed.
    - If axis is 1 or -1, only columns are suppressed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, MaskedArray
        The array to operate on.  If not a MaskedArray instance (or if no array
        elements are masked), `x` is interpreted as a MaskedArray with
        `mask` set to `nomask`. Must be a 2D array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to perform the operation. Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    compressed_array : ndarray
        The compressed array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3), mask=[[1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                   [1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                   [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> x
    masked_array(
      data=[[--, 1, 2],
            [--, 4, 5],
            [6, 7, 8]],
      mask=[[ True, False, False],
            [ True, False, False],
            [False, False, False]],
      fill_value=999999)

    >>> np.ma.compress_rowcols(x)
    array([[7, 8]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_rowcols(x, 0)
    array([[6, 7, 8]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_rowcols(x, 1)
    array([[1, 2],
           [4, 5],
           [7, 8]])

    Suppressing columns with all masked values:
    
    >>> x = np.ma.array(np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3), mask=[[1, 1, 0],
    ...                                                   [1, 1, 0],
    ...                                                   [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_rowcols(x, 1)
    array([[2],
           [5],
           [8]])


I decided to add an example to demonstrate the case where columns with all masked values are suppressed. This example helps to illustrate the behavior of the function when the mask is not limited to the first row.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of the function, and the additional example provides further clarification on the behavior of the function.
