I will provide you with the docstring for the masked_invalid function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.masked_invalid. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Mask an array where invalid values occur (NaNs or infs).

    This function is a shortcut to ``masked_where``, with
    `condition` = ~(np.isfinite(a)). Any pre-existing mask is conserved.
    Only applies to arrays with a dtype where NaNs or infs make sense
    (i.e. floating point types), but accepts any array_like object.

    See Also
    --------
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> a = np.arange(5, dtype=float)
    >>> a[2] = np.nan
    >>> a[3] = np.inf
    >>> a
    array([ 0.,  1., nan, inf,  4.])
    >>> ma.masked_invalid(a)
    masked_array(data=[0.0, 1.0, --, --, 4.0],
                 mask=[False, False,  True,  True, False],
           fill_value=1e+20)

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Mask an array where invalid values occur (NaNs or infs).

    This function is a shortcut to ``masked_where``, with
    `condition` = ~(np.isfinite(a)). Any pre-existing mask is conserved.
    Only applies to arrays with a dtype where NaNs or infs make sense
    (i.e. floating point types), but accepts any array_like object.

    See Also
    --------
    masked_where : Mask where a condition is met.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> a = np.arange(5, dtype=float)
    >>> a[2] = np.nan
    >>> a[3] = np.inf
    >>> a
    array([ 0.,  1., nan, inf,  4.])
    >>> ma.masked_invalid(a)
    masked_array(data=[0.0, 1.0, --, --, 4.0],
                 mask=[False, False,  True,  True, False],
           fill_value=1e+20)

    Using masked_invalid on a 2D array:
    
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, np.nan], [4, np.inf, 6]])
    >>> ma.masked_invalid(a)
    masked_array(data=[[1.0, 2.0, --],
                         [4.0, --, 6.0]],
                 mask=[[False, False,  True],
                       [False,  True, False]],
           fill_value=1e+20)


I decided to add an example to demonstrate how `masked_invalid` works with a 2D array. This is because the original examples only show its usage with a 1D array, and it's important to illustrate its behavior with higher-dimensional arrays.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `masked_invalid`, and the additional example I added demonstrates its usage with a 2D array. Further examples might be redundant or unnecessary, as the function's behavior is straightforward and well-documented.
