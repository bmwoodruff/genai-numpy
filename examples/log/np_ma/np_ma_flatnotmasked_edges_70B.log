I will provide you with the docstring for the flatnotmasked_edges function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.flatnotmasked_edges. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Find the indices of the first and last unmasked values.

    Expects a 1-D `MaskedArray`, returns None if all values are masked.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input 1-D `MaskedArray`

    Returns
    -------
    edges : ndarray or None
        The indices of first and last non-masked value in the array.
        Returns None if all values are masked.

    See Also
    --------
    flatnotmasked_contiguous, notmasked_contiguous, notmasked_edges
    clump_masked, clump_unmasked

    Notes
    -----
    Only accepts 1-D arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.ma.arange(10)
    >>> np.ma.flatnotmasked_edges(a)
    array([0, 9])

    >>> mask = (a < 3) | (a > 8) | (a == 5)
    >>> a[mask] = np.ma.masked
    >>> np.array(a[~a.mask])
    array([3, 4, 6, 7, 8])

    >>> np.ma.flatnotmasked_edges(a)
    array([3, 8])

    >>> a[:] = np.ma.masked
    >>> print(np.ma.flatnotmasked_edges(a))
    None

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.ma.arange(10)
    >>> np.ma.flatnotmasked_edges(a)
    array([0, 9])

    >>> mask = (a < 3) | (a > 8) | (a == 5)
    >>> a[mask] = np.ma.masked
    >>> np.array(a[~a.mask])
    array([3, 4, 6, 7, 8])

    >>> np.ma.flatnotmasked_edges(a)
    array([3, 8])

    >>> a[:] = np.ma.masked
    >>> print(np.ma.flatnotmasked_edges(a))
    None

    Edge case with a single element array:
    
    >>> a = np.ma.array([1])
    >>> np.ma.flatnotmasked_edges(a)
    array([0, 0])

I decided to add this example because it covers an edge case that was not previously demonstrated: a single-element array. This example shows that the function still works correctly in this scenario, returning the indices of the first and last unmasked values, which in this case are the same.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples, along with the new one, provide a comprehensive demonstration of the function's behavior in various scenarios, including arrays with no masked values, arrays with some masked values, and arrays with all masked values. The additional example covers an edge case, and further examples would likely be redundant or not provide additional insight into the function's behavior.
