I will provide you with the docstring for the compress_cols function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.compress_cols. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Suppress whole columns of a 2-D array that contain masked values.

    This is equivalent to ``np.ma.compress_rowcols(a, 1)``, see
    `compress_rowcols` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, MaskedArray
        The array to operate on.  If not a MaskedArray instance (or if no array
        elements are masked), `x` is interpreted as a MaskedArray with
        `mask` set to `nomask`. Must be a 2D array.

    Returns
    -------
    compressed_array : ndarray
        The compressed array.

    --------
    compress_rowcols

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.ma.array(np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3), mask=[[1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                   [1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                   [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_cols(a)
    array([[1, 2],
           [4, 5],
           [7, 8]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Suppress whole columns of a 2-D array that contain masked values.

    This is equivalent to ``np.ma.compress_rowcols(a, 1)``, see
    `compress_rowcols` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, MaskedArray
        The array to operate on.  If not a MaskedArray instance (or if no array
        elements are masked), `x` is interpreted as a MaskedArray with
        `mask` set to `nomask`. Must be a 2D array.

    Returns
    -------
    compressed_array : ndarray
        The compressed array.

    See Also
    --------
    compress_rowcols

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.ma.array(np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3), mask=[[1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                   [1, 0, 0],
    ...                                                   [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_cols(a)
    array([[1, 2],
           [4, 5],
           [7, 8]])

    No masked columns:
    >>> b = np.ma.array(np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3), mask=[[0, 0, 0],
    ...                                                   [0, 0, 0],
    ...                                                   [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> np.ma.compress_cols(b)
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])
