I will provide you with the docstring for the amax function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.amax. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return the maximum of an array or maximum along an axis.

    `amax` is an alias of `~numpy.max`.

    See Also
    --------
    max : alias of this function
    ndarray.max : equivalent method

    Examples:
    --------
    Maximum of an entire array:
    
    >>> np.ma.amax([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    5
    
    Maximum of a two-dimensional array along the first axis:
    
    >>> m = np.ma.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.ma.amax(m, axis=0)
    masked_array(data=[4, 5, 6],
                 mask=[False, False, False],
           fill_value=999999)

    Maximum of a two-dimensional array along the second axis:
    
    >>> m = np.ma.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.ma.amax(m, axis=1)
    masked_array(data=[3, 6],
                 mask=[False, False],
           fill_value=999999)

    Maximum of a masked array:
    
    >>> m = np.ma.array([1, 2, 3], mask=[True, False, False])
    >>> np.ma.amax(m)
    3


I decided to add the fourth example because it demonstrates how `np.ma.amax` handles masked arrays, which is an important aspect of masked arrays. This example shows that the maximum value is taken from the unmasked elements.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples, along with the new one, cover the main use cases of `np.ma.amax`: finding the maximum of a one-dimensional array, finding the maximum along an axis of a multi-dimensional array, and handling masked arrays. Adding more examples would likely be redundant or demonstrate edge cases that are not commonly encountered.
