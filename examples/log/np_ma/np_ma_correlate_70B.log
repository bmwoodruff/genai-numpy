I will provide you with the docstring for the correlate function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.correlate. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Cross-correlation of two 1-dimensional sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, v : array_like
        Input sequences.
    mode : {'valid', 'same', 'full'}, optional
        Refer to the `np.convolve` docstring.  Note that the default
        is 'valid', unlike `convolve`, which uses 'full'.
    propagate_mask : bool
        If True, then a result element is masked if any masked element contributes towards it.
        If False, then a result element is only masked if no non-masked element
        contribute towards it

    Returns
    -------
    out : MaskedArray
        Discrete cross-correlation of `a` and `v`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.correlate : Equivalent function in the top-level NumPy module.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Cross-correlation of two 1-dimensional sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, v : array_like
        Input sequences.
    mode : {'valid', 'same', 'full'}, optional
        Refer to the `np.convolve` docstring.  Note that the default
        is 'valid', unlike `convolve`, which uses 'full'.
    propagate_mask : bool
        If True, then a result element is masked if any masked element contributes towards it.
        If False, then a result element is only masked if no non-masked element
        contribute towards it

    Returns
    -------
    out : MaskedArray
        Discrete cross-correlation of `a` and `v`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.correlate : Equivalent function in the top-level NumPy module.

    Examples:
    Basic correlation:
    >>> a = np.ma.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> v = np.ma.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> np.ma.correlate(a, v, mode='full')
    masked_array(data=[0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 12],
                 mask=[False, False, False, False, False, False],
                 fill_value=999999)

    Using masked arrays:
    >>> a = np.ma.array([0, 1, 2, 3], mask=[False, False, True, False])
    >>> v = np.ma.array([0, 1, 2, 3], mask=[False, False, False, True])
    >>> np.ma.correlate(a, v, mode='valid', propagate_mask=True)
    masked_array(data=[4, 6],
                 mask=[False, True],
                 fill_value=999999)

    Propagate mask with mode 'same':
    >>> a = np.ma.array([0, 1, 2, 3], mask=[False, False, True, False])
    >>> v = np.ma.array([0, 1, 2, 3], mask=[False, False, False, True])
    >>> np.ma.correlate(a, v, mode='same', propagate_mask=True)
    masked_array(data=[2, 4, 6],
                 mask=[False, True, True],
                 fill_value=999999)
