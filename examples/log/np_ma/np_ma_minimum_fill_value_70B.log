I will provide you with the docstring for the minimum_fill_value function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.minimum_fill_value. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the maximum value that can be represented by the dtype of an object.

    This function is useful for calculating a fill value suitable for
    taking the minimum of an array with a given dtype.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : ndarray, dtype or scalar
        An object that can be queried for it's numeric type.

    Returns
    -------
    val : scalar
        The maximum representable value.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If `obj` isn't a suitable numeric type.

    See Also
    --------
    maximum_fill_value : The inverse function.
    set_fill_value : Set the filling value of a masked array.
    MaskedArray.fill_value : Return current fill value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma
    >>> a = np.int8()
    >>> ma.minimum_fill_value(a)
    127
    >>> a = np.int32()
    >>> ma.minimum_fill_value(a)
    2147483647

    An array of numeric data can also be passed.

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int8)
    >>> ma.minimum_fill_value(a)
    127
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.float32)
    >>> ma.minimum_fill_value(a)

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return the maximum value that can be represented by the dtype of an object.

    This function is useful for calculating a fill value suitable for
    taking the minimum of an array with a given dtype.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : ndarray, dtype or scalar
        An object that can be queried for it's numeric type.

    Returns
    -------
    val : scalar
        The maximum representable value.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If `obj` isn't a suitable numeric type.

    See Also
    --------
    maximum_fill_value : The inverse function.
    set_fill_value : Set the filling value of a masked array.
    MaskedArray.fill_value : Return current fill value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.ma as ma

    >>> ma.minimum_fill_value(a)
    127
    >>> a = np.int32()

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int8)
    >>> ma.minimum_fill_value(a)
    127
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.float32)
    >>> ma.minimum_fill_value(a)
    inf

    Minimum fill value for complex64 dtype:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.complex64)
    >>> ma.minimum_fill_value(a)
    (inf+1j*inf)
