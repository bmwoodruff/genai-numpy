I will provide you with the docstring for the min function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.min. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        Return the minimum along a given axis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
            Axis along which to operate.  By default, ``axis`` is None and the
            flattened input is used.
            .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
            If this is a tuple of ints, the minimum is selected over multiple
            axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
        out : array_like, optional
            Alternative output array in which to place the result.  Must be of
            the same shape and buffer length as the expected output.
        fill_value : scalar or None, optional
            Value used to fill in the masked values.
            If None, use the output of `minimum_fill_value`.
        keepdims : bool, optional
            If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
            in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
            the result will broadcast correctly against the array.

        Returns
        -------
        amin : array_like
            New array holding the result.
            If ``out`` was specified, ``out`` is returned.

        --------
        ma.minimum_fill_value
            Returns the minimum filling value for a given datatype.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import numpy.ma as ma
        >>> x = [[1., -2., 3.], [0.2, -0.7, 0.1]]
        >>> mask = [[1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
        >>> masked_x = ma.masked_array(x, mask)
        >>> masked_x
        masked_array(
          data=[[--, --, 3.0],
                [0.2, -0.7, --]],
          mask=[[ True,  True, False],
                [False, False,  True]],
          fill_value=1e+20)
        >>> ma.min(masked_x)
        -0.7
        >>> ma.min(masked_x, axis=-1)
        masked_array(data=[3.0, -0.7],
                     mask=[False, False],
                fill_value=1e+20)
        >>> ma.min(masked_x, axis=0, keepdims=True)
        masked_array(data=[[0.2, -0.7, 3.0]],
                     mask=[[False, False, False]],
                fill_value=1e+20)
        >>> mask = [[1, 1, 1,], [1, 1, 1]]
        >>> masked_x = ma.masked_array(x, mask)
        >>> ma.min(masked_x, axis=0)
        masked_array(data=[--, --, --],
                     mask=[ True,  True,  True],
                fill_value=1e+20,
                    dtype=float64)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import numpy.ma as ma
        >>> x = [[1., -2., 3.], [0.2, -0.7, 0.1]]
        >>> mask = [[1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
        >>> masked_x = ma.masked_array(x, mask)
        >>> masked_x
        masked_array(
          data=[[--, --, 3.0],
                [0.2, -0.7, --]],
          mask=[[ True,  True, False],
                [False, False,  True]],
          fill_value=1e+20)
        >>> ma.min(masked_x)
        -0.7
        >>> ma.min(masked_x, axis=-1)
        masked_array(data=[3.0, -0.7],
                     mask=[False, False],
                fill_value=1e+20)
        >>> ma.min(masked_x, axis=0, keepdims=True)
        masked_array(data=[[0.2, -0.7, 3.0]],
                     mask=[[False, False, False]],
                fill_value=1e+20)
        >>> mask = [[1, 1, 1,], [1, 1, 1]]
        >>> masked_x = ma.masked_array(x, mask)
        >>> ma.min(masked_x, axis=0)
        masked_array(data=[--, --, --],
                     mask=[ True,  True,  True],
                fill_value=1e+20,
                    dtype=float64)

        Using fill_value:
        >>> ma.min(masked_x, fill_value=-1)
        -1.0

I decided to add an example that demonstrates the use of the `fill_value` parameter. This is an important feature of the `ma.min` function, and it's not shown in the existing examples. This new example shows how to use `fill_value` to specify a custom value to replace masked values.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a good range of use cases, including using `axis` and `keepdims`. The new example I added provides additional information about using `fill_value`, which is an important aspect of the function.
