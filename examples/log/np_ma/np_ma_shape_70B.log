I will provide you with the docstring for the shape function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.shape. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the shape of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    shape : tuple of ints
        The elements of the shape tuple give the lengths of the
        corresponding array dimensions.

    See Also
    --------
    len : ``len(a)`` is equivalent to ``np.shape(a)[0]`` for N-D arrays with
          ``N>=1``.
    ndarray.shape : Equivalent array method.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.shape(np.eye(3))
    (3, 3)
    >>> np.shape([[1, 3]])
    (1, 2)
    >>> np.shape([0])
    (1,)
    >>> np.shape(0)
    ()

    >>> a = np.array([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)],
    ...              dtype=[('x', 'i4'), ('y', 'i4')])
    >>> np.shape(a)
    (3,)
    >>> a.shape
    (3,)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.shape(np.eye(3))
    (3, 3)
    >>> np.shape([[1, 3]])
    (1, 2)
    >>> np.shape([0])
    (1,)
    >>> np.shape(0)
    ()
    >>> a = np.array([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)],
    ...              dtype=[('x', 'i4'), ('y', 'i4')])
    >>> np.shape(a)
    (3,)
    >>> a.shape
    (3,)
    Multidimensional array with different lengths:
    
    >>> b = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
    >>> np.ma.shape(b)
    (2, 2, 3)

I decided to add an example of a multidimensional array with different lengths because the existing examples only show arrays with up to 2 dimensions. This new example demonstrates how the shape function works with higher-dimensional arrays.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples, along with the new one, cover a good range of cases, including 0-D, 1-D, 2-D, and multidimensional arrays. The new example adds a new dimension to the existing examples, making the documentation more comprehensive.
