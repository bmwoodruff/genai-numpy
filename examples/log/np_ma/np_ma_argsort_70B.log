I will provide you with the docstring for the argsort function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.argsort. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        Return an ndarray of indices that sort the array along the
        specified axis.  Masked values are filled beforehand to
        `fill_value`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : int, optional
            Axis along which to sort. If None, the default, the flattened array
            is used.

            ..  versionchanged:: 1.13.0
                Previously, the default was documented to be -1, but that was
                in error. At some future date, the default will change to -1, as
                originally intended.
                Until then, the axis should be given explicitly when
                ``arr.ndim > 1``, to avoid a FutureWarning.
        kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
            The sorting algorithm used.
        order : list, optional
            When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
            which fields to compare first, second, etc.  Not all fields need be
            specified.
        endwith : {True, False}, optional
            Whether missing values (if any) should be treated as the largest values
            (True) or the smallest values (False)
            When the array contains unmasked values at the same extremes of the
            datatype, the ordering of these values and the masked values is
            undefined.
        fill_value : scalar or None, optional
            Value used internally for the masked values.
            If ``fill_value`` is not None, it supersedes ``endwith``.
        stable : bool, optional
            Only for compatibility with ``np.argsort``. Ignored.

        Returns
        -------
        index_array : ndarray, int
            Array of indices that sort `a` along the specified axis.
            In other words, ``a[index_array]`` yields a sorted `a`.

        See Also
        --------
        ma.MaskedArray.sort : Describes sorting algorithms used.
        lexsort : Indirect stable sort with multiple keys.
        numpy.ndarray.sort : Inplace sort.

        Notes
        -----
        See `sort` for notes on the different sorting algorithms.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> a = np.ma.array([3,2,1], mask=[False, False, True])
        >>> a
        masked_array(data=[3, 2, --],
                     mask=[False, False,  True],
               fill_value=999999)
        >>> a.argsort()
        array([1, 0, 2])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

        Examples
        --------
        >>> a = np.ma.array([3,2,1], mask=[False, False, True])
        >>> a
        masked_array(data=[3, 2, --],
                     mask=[False, False,  True],
               fill_value=999999)
        >>> a.argsort()
        array([1, 0, 2])

        Sorting along a specific axis:
        
        >>> a = np.ma.array([[3,2,1],[4,5,6]], mask=[[False, False, True],[False, False, False]])
        >>> a
        masked_array(data=[[[3, 2, --],
                              [4, 5, 6]]],
                     mask=[[False, False,  True],
                            [False, False,  False]],
               fill_value=999999)
        >>> np.ma.argsort(a, axis=1)
        array([[1, 0, 2],
               [0, 1, 2]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the usage of the `axis` parameter, which allows sorting along a specific axis. This example shows how to sort a 2D masked array along the columns (axis=1).

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic usage of `argsort` with a 1D masked array, and the new example covers the usage with a higher-dimensional array. Additional examples might be redundant or too specific, and the existing documentation already provides a good understanding of the function's behavior.
