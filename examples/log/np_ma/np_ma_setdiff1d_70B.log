I will provide you with the docstring for the setdiff1d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.setdiff1d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Set difference of 1D arrays with unique elements.

    The output is always a masked array. See `numpy.setdiff1d` for more
    details.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.setdiff1d : Equivalent function for ndarrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.ma.array([1, 2, 3, 4], mask=[0, 1, 0, 1])
    >>> np.ma.setdiff1d(x, [1, 2])
    masked_array(data=[3, --],
                 mask=[False,  True],
           fill_value=999999)

    Different mask:
    >>> y = np.ma.array([1, 2, 3, 4], mask=[1, 0, 1, 0])
    >>> np.ma.setdiff1d(y, [1, 2])
    masked_array(data=[--, 4],
                 mask=[ True, False],
           fill_value=999999)

I decided to add the second example because it shows a different scenario where the mask is applied to different elements of the array. This helps to illustrate how the function behaves when the mask is applied differently.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already covers the basic functionality of the function, and the additional example provides a slight variation. Adding more examples might be redundant and might not provide significant additional insight into the function's behavior.
