I will provide you with the docstring for the ptp function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.ptp. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        Return (maximum - minimum) along the given dimension
        (i.e. peak-to-peak value).

        .. warning::
            `ptp` preserves the data type of the array. This means the
            return value for an input of signed integers with n bits
            (e.g. `np.int8`, `np.int16`, etc) is also a signed integer
            with n bits.  In that case, peak-to-peak values greater than
            ``2**(n-1)-1`` will be returned as negative values. An example
            with a work-around is shown below.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : {None, int}, optional
            Axis along which to find the peaks.  If None (default) the
            flattened array is used.
        out : {None, array_like}, optional
            Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
            have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
            but the type will be cast if necessary.
        fill_value : scalar or None, optional
            Value used to fill in the masked values.
        keepdims : bool, optional
            If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
            in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
            the result will broadcast correctly against the array.

        Returns
        -------
        ptp : ndarray.
            A new array holding the result, unless ``out`` was
            specified, in which case a reference to ``out`` is returned.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.MaskedArray([[4, 9, 2, 10],
        ...                        [6, 9, 7, 12]])

        >>> x.ptp(axis=1)
        masked_array(data=[8, 6],
                     mask=False,
               fill_value=999999)

        >>> x.ptp(axis=0)
        masked_array(data=[2, 0, 5, 2],
                     mask=False,
               fill_value=999999)

        >>> x.ptp()
        10

        This example shows that a negative value can be returned when
        the input is an array of signed integers.

        >>> y = np.ma.MaskedArray([[1, 127],
        ...                        [0, 127],
        ...                        [-1, 127],
        ...                        [-2, 127]], dtype=np.int8)
        >>> y.ptp(axis=1)
        masked_array(data=[ 126,  127, -128, -127],
                     mask=False,
               fill_value=np.int64(999999),
                    dtype=int8)

        A work-around is to use the `view()` method to view the result as
        unsigned integers with the same bit width:

        >>> y.ptp(axis=1).view(np.uint8)
        masked_array(data=[126, 127, 128, 129],
                     mask=False,
               fill_value=np.int64(999999),
                    dtype=uint8)

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = np.ma.MaskedArray([[4, 9, 2, 10],
        ...                        [6, 9, 7, 12]])

        >>> x.ptp(axis=1)
        masked_array(data=[8, 6],
                     mask=False,
               fill_value=999999)

        >>> x.ptp(axis=0)
        masked_array(data=[2, 0, 5, 2],
                     mask=False,
               fill_value=999999)

        >>> x.ptp()
        10

        This example shows that a negative value can be returned when
        the input is an array of signed integers.

        >>> y = np.ma.MaskedArray([[1, 127],
        ...                        [0, 127],
        ...                        [-1, 127],
        ...                        [-2, 127]], dtype=np.int8)
        >>> y.ptp(axis=1)
        masked_array(data=[ 126,  127, -128, -127],
                     mask=False,
               fill_value=np.int64(999999),
                    dtype=int8)

        A work-around is to use the `view()` method to view the result as
        unsigned integers with the same bit width:

        >>> y.ptp(axis=1).view(np.uint8)
        masked_array(data=[126, 127, 128, 129],
                     mask=False,
               fill_value=np.int64(999999),
                    dtype=uint8)

        Using ptp with a 3D array:
        
        >>> z = np.ma.MaskedArray([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],
        ...                         [[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]]])
        >>> np.ma.ptp(z, axis=1)
        masked_array(data=[[9, 9, 9],
                     [9, 9, 9]],
                     mask=False,
               fill_value=999999)
