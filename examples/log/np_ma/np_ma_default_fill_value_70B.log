I will provide you with the docstring for the default_fill_value function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ma.default_fill_value. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the default fill value for the argument object.

    The default filling value depends on the datatype of the input
    array or the type of the input scalar:

       ========  ========
       datatype  default
       ========  ========
       bool      True
       int       999999
       float     1.e20
       complex   1.e20+0j
       object    '?'
       string    'N/A'
       ========  ========

    For structured types, a structured scalar is returned, with each field the
    default fill value for its type.

    For subarray types, the fill value is an array of the same size containing
    the default scalar fill value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : ndarray, dtype or scalar
        The array data-type or scalar for which the default fill value
        is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    fill_value : scalar
        The default fill value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.ma.default_fill_value(1)
    999999
    >>> np.ma.default_fill_value(np.array([1.1, 2., np.pi]))
    1e+20
    >>> np.ma.default_fill_value(np.dtype(complex))
    (1e+20+0j)

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.ma.default_fill_value(1)
    999999
    >>> np.ma.default_fill_value(np.array([1.1, 2., np.pi]))
    1e+20
    >>> np.ma.default_fill_value(np.dtype(complex))
    (1e+20+0j)
    Boolean example:
    >>> np.ma.default_fill_value(np.bool_)
    True

I decided to add an example for the boolean data type because it was not represented in the existing examples. This example helps to illustrate the default fill value for boolean data types, which is True.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a good range of data types (integer, float, complex), and the additional example I added covers the boolean data type. The documentation already provides a clear table explaining the default fill values for different data types, so further examples may not add significant value.
