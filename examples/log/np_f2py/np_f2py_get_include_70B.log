I will provide you with the docstring for the get_include function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.f2py.get_include. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the directory that contains the ``fortranobject.c`` and ``.h`` files.

    .. note::

        This function is not needed when building an extension with
        `numpy.distutils` directly from ``.f`` and/or ``.pyf`` files
        in one go.

    Python extension modules built with f2py-generated code need to use
    ``fortranobject.c`` as a source file, and include the ``fortranobject.h``
    header. This function can be used to obtain the directory containing
    both of these files.

    Returns
    -------
    include_path : str
        Absolute path to the directory containing ``fortranobject.c`` and
        ``fortranobject.h``.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.21.1

    Unless the build system you are using has specific support for f2py,
    building a Python extension using a ``.pyf`` signature file is a two-step
    process. For a module ``mymod``:

    * Step 1: run ``python -m numpy.f2py mymod.pyf --quiet``. This
      generates ``mymodmodule.c`` and (if needed)
      ``mymod-f2pywrappers.f`` files next to ``mymod.pyf``.
    * Step 2: build your Python extension module. This requires the
      following source files:

      * ``mymodmodule.c``
      * ``mymod-f2pywrappers.f`` (if it was generated in Step 1)
      * ``fortranobject.c``

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return the directory that contains the ``fortranobject.c`` and ``.h`` files.

        `numpy.distutils` directly from ``.f`` and/or ``.pyf`` files
