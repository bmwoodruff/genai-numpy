I will provide you with the docstring for the run_main function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.f2py.run_main. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Equivalent to running::

        f2py <args>

    where ``<args>=string.join(<list>,' ')``, but in Python.  Unless
    ``-h`` is used, this function returns a dictionary containing
    information on generated modules and their dependencies on source
    files.

    You cannot build extension modules with this function, that is,
    using ``-c`` is not allowed. Use the ``compile`` command instead.

    Examples
    --------
    The command ``f2py -m scalar scalar.f`` can be executed from Python as
    follows.

    .. literalinclude:: ../../source/f2py/code/results/run_main_session.dat
        :language: python

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Equivalent to running::

        f2py <args>

    where ``<args>=string.join(<list>,' ')``, but in Python.  Unless
    ``-h`` is used, this function returns a dictionary containing
    information on generated modules and their dependencies on source
    files.

    You cannot build extension modules with this function, that is,
    using ``-c`` is not allowed. Use the ``compile`` command instead.

    Examples
    --------
    The command ``f2py -m scalar scalar.f`` can be executed from Python as
    follows.

    .. literalinclude:: ../../source/f2py/code/results/run_main_session.dat
        :language: python

    Running f2py with multiple source files:

    
    >>> np.f2py.run_main(['-m', 'module', 'file1.f', 'file2.f'])
    

I decided to add this example because the original docstring only showed how to execute a simple f2py command from Python, but it didn't demonstrate how to handle more complex scenarios, such as when there are multiple source files involved. This additional example provides a more comprehensive understanding of how to use the `run_main` function.

I stopped here because the current examples, including the new one, provide a good representation of how to use the `run_main` function. The original example shows the basic usage, and the new example demonstrates a more complex scenario. Adding more examples at this point would likely be redundant or unnecessary.
