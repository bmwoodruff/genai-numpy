I will provide you with the docstring for the arctanh function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.emath.arctanh. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see
    `numpy.arctanh`) of ``arctanh(x)``. For real `x` such that
    ``abs(x) < 1``, this is a real number.  If `abs(x) > 1`, or if `x` is
    complex, the result is complex. Finally, `x = 1` returns``inf`` and
    ``x=-1`` returns ``-inf``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       The value(s) whose arctanh is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The inverse hyperbolic tangent(s) of the `x` value(s). If `x` was
       a scalar so is `out`, otherwise an array is returned.


    See Also
    --------
    numpy.arctanh

    Notes
    -----
    For an arctanh() that returns ``NAN`` when real `x` is not in the
    interval ``(-1,1)``, use `numpy.arctanh` (this latter, however, does
    return +/-inf for ``x = +/-1``).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.emath.arctanh(0.5)
    0.5493061443340549

    >>> from numpy.testing import suppress_warnings
    >>> with suppress_warnings() as sup:
    ...     sup.filter(RuntimeWarning)
    ...     np.emath.arctanh(np.eye(2))
    array([[inf,  0.],
           [ 0., inf]])
    >>> np.emath.arctanh([1j])
    array([0.+0.7854j])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.emath.arctanh(0.5)
    0.5493061443340549

    >>> from numpy.testing import suppress_warnings
    >>> with suppress_warnings() as sup:
    ...     sup.filter(RuntimeWarning)
    ...     np.emath.arctanh(np.eye(2))
    array([[inf,  0.],
           [ 0., inf]])
    >>> np.emath.arctanh([1j])
    array([0.+0.7854j])

    Negative input:
    >>> np.emath.arctanh(-0.5)
    -0.5493061443340549


I decided to add an example to show the behavior of `np.emath.arctanh` with a negative input, as the existing examples only show the behavior with positive inputs and complex inputs. This new example helps to illustrate the symmetry of the function around zero.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a good range of cases, including a scalar input, a matrix input, and a complex input. The new example I added helps to fill a small gap in the coverage, but further examples would likely be redundant or only show minor variations on the existing examples.
