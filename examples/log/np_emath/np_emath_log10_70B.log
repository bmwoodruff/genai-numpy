I will provide you with the docstring for the log10 function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.emath.log10. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the logarithm base 10 of `x`.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see
    `numpy.log10`) of :math:`log_{10}(x)`. For real `x > 0`, this
    is a real number (``log10(0)`` returns ``-inf`` and ``log10(np.inf)``
    returns ``inf``). Otherwise, the complex principle value is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like or scalar
       The value(s) whose log base 10 is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The log base 10 of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so is `out`,
       otherwise an array object is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.log10

    Notes
    -----
    For a log10() that returns ``NAN`` when real `x < 0`, use `numpy.log10`
    (note, however, that otherwise `numpy.log10` and this `log10` are
    identical, i.e., both return ``-inf`` for `x = 0`, ``inf`` for `x = inf`,
    and, notably, the complex principle value if ``x.imag != 0``).

    Examples
    --------

    (We set the printing precision so the example can be auto-tested)

    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.emath.log10(10**1)
    1.0

    >>> np.emath.log10([-10**1, -10**2, 10**2])
    array([1.+1.3644j, 2.+1.3644j, 2.+0.j    ])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    (We set the printing precision so the example can be auto-tested)

    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.emath.log10(10**1)
    1.0

    >>> np.emath.log10([-10**1, -10**2, 10**2])
    array([1.+1.3644j, 2.+1.3644j, 2.+0.j    ])

    Logarithm base 10 of zero and infinity:
    
    >>> np.emath.log10([0, np.inf])
    array([-inf,  inf])

I decided to add an example to show the behavior of `np.emath.log10` when the input is zero or infinity, as this is mentioned in the description but not explicitly shown in the existing examples. This example helps to clarify the behavior of the function in edge cases.

I stopped here because the existing examples already demonstrate the basic functionality of the function, and the additional example I added covers an important edge case. Further examples might be redundant or unnecessary at this point.
