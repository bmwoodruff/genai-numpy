I will provide you with the docstring for the arcsin function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.emath.arcsin. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the inverse sine of x.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see
    `numpy.arcsin`) of the inverse sine of `x`. For real `x` such that
    `abs(x) <= 1`, this is a real number in the closed interval
    :math:`[-\pi/2, \pi/2]`.  Otherwise, the complex principle value is
    returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like or scalar
       The value(s) whose arcsin is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The inverse sine(s) of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so
       is `out`, otherwise an array object is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.arcsin

    Notes
    -----
    For an arcsin() that returns ``NAN`` when real `x` is not in the
    interval ``[-1,1]``, use `numpy.arcsin`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

    >>> np.emath.arcsin(0)
    0.0

    >>> np.emath.arcsin([0,1])
    array([0.    , 1.5708])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Compute the inverse sine of x.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see
    `numpy.arcsin`) of the inverse sine of `x`. For real `x` such that
    `abs(x) <= 1`, this is a real number in the closed interval
    :math:`[-\pi/2, \pi/2]`.  Otherwise, the complex principle value is
    returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like or scalar
       The value(s) whose arcsin is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The inverse sine(s) of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so
       is `out`, otherwise an array object is returned.
