I will provide you with the docstring for the polyval3d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.polynomial.polyval3d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Evaluate a 3-D polynomial at points (x, y, z).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y,z) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * x^i * y^j * z^k

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if
    they are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and
    they must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either
    `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support multiplication and
    addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than 3 dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to its
    shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible object
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points
        ``(x, y, z)``, where `x`, `y`, and `z` must have the same shape.  If
        any of `x`, `y`, or `z` is a list or tuple, it is first converted
        to an ndarray, otherwise it is left unchanged and if it isn't an
        ndarray it is  treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j,k is contained in ``c[i,j,k]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than 3 the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the multidimensional polynomial on points formed with
        triples of corresponding values from `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Evaluate a 3-D polynomial at points (x, y, z).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y,z) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * x^i * y^j * z^k

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if
    they are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and
    they must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either
    `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support multiplication and
    addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than 3 dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to its
    shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible object
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points
        ``(x, y, z)``, where `x`, `y`, and `z` must have the same shape.  If
        any of `x`, `y`, or `z` is a list or tuple, it is first converted
        to an ndarray, otherwise it is left unchanged and if it isn't an
        ndarray it is  treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j,k is contained in ``c[i,j,k]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than 3 the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the multidimensional polynomial on points formed with
        triples of corresponding values from `x`, `y`, and `z`.
