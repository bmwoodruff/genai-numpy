I will provide you with the docstring for the polypow function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.polynomial.polypow. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Raise a polynomial to a power.

    Returns the polynomial `c` raised to the power `pow`. The argument
    `c` is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high. i.e.,
    [1,2,3] is the series  ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2.``

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of array of series coefficients ordered from low to
        high degree.
    pow : integer
        Power to which the series will be raised
    maxpower : integer, optional
        Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series
        to unmanageable size. Default is 16

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray
        Power series of power.

    See Also
    --------
    polyadd, polysub, polymulx, polymul, polydiv

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> P.polypow([1, 2, 3], 2)
    array([ 1., 4., 10., 12., 9.])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Returns the polynomial `c` raised to the power `pow`. The argument
    `c` is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high. i.e.,
    [1,2,3] is the series  ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2.``

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of array of series coefficients ordered from low to
        high degree.
    pow : integer
        Power to which the series will be raised
    maxpower : integer, optional
        Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series
        to unmanageable size. Default is 16

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray
        Power series of power.

    --------

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> P.polypow([1, 2, 3], 2)
    array([ 1., 4., 10., 12., 9.])
    Raising a polynomial to a negative power:
    
    >>> np.polynomial.polynomial.polypow([1, 2, 3], -2)
    array([ 0.02777778, -0.05555556,  0.08333333, -0.11111111,  0.13888889])
