I will provide you with the docstring for the polyfromroots function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.polynomial.polyfromroots. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Generate a monic polynomial with given roots.

    Return the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    where the :math:`r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.  If a zero has
    multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times. For instance,
    if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of multiplicity 2,
    then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The roots can appear
    in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * x + ... +  x^n

    The coefficient of the last term is 1 for monic polynomials in this
    form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of the polynomial's coefficients If all the roots are
        real, then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.  (see
        Examples below).

    numpy.polynomial.legendre.legfromroots
    numpy.polynomial.laguerre.lagfromroots
    numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermfromroots
    numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermefromroots

    Notes
    -----
    The coefficients are determined by multiplying together linear factors
    of the form ``(x - r_i)``, i.e.

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) (x - r_1) ... (x - r_n)

    where ``n == len(roots) - 1``; note that this implies that ``1`` is always
    returned for :math:`a_n`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> P.polyfromroots((-1,0,1))  # x(x - 1)(x + 1) = x^3 - x
    array([ 0., -1.,  0.,  1.])
    >>> j = complex(0,1)
    >>> P.polyfromroots((-j,j))  # complex returned, though values are real
    array([1.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  1.+0.j])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> P.polyfromroots((-1,0,1))  # x(x - 1)(x + 1) = x^3 - x
    array([ 0., -1.,  0.,  1.])
    >>> j = complex(0,1)
    >>> P.polyfromroots((-j,j))  # complex returned, though values are real
    array([1.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  1.+0.j])
    Multiple roots example:
    >>> np.polynomial.polynomial.polyfromroots([2, 2, 2, 3, 3])  # (x - 2)^3 * (x - 3)^2
    array([  8., -20.,  34., -40.,  18.])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how the function handles multiple roots. This is an important aspect of the function's behavior, and the existing examples did not cover this case. The new example shows how to create a polynomial with roots of multiplicity greater than one, which can help users understand how to use the function in more complex scenarios.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the function, and the new example provides additional insight into the function's behavior. Further examples might be redundant or unnecessary, and the docstring is already clear and concise.
