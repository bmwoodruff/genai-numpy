I will provide you with the docstring for the polyder function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.polynomial.polyder. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Differentiate a polynomial.

    Returns the polynomial coefficients `c` differentiated `m` times along
    `axis`.  At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (the
    scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable).  The
    argument `c` is an array of coefficients from low to high degree along
    each axis, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the polynomial ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2``
    while [[1,2],[1,2]] represents ``1 + 1*x + 2*y + 2*x*y`` if axis=0 is
    ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of polynomial coefficients. If c is multidimensional the
        different axis correspond to different variables with the degree
        in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Number of derivatives taken, must be non-negative. (Default: 1)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Each differentiation is multiplied by `scl`.  The end result is
        multiplication by ``scl**m``.  This is for use in a linear change
        of variable. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the derivative is taken. (Default: 0).

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    der : ndarray
        Polynomial coefficients of the derivative.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c = (1, 2, 3, 4)
    >>> P.polyder(c)  # (d/dx)(c)
    array([  2.,   6.,  12.])
    >>> P.polyder(c, 3)  # (d**3/dx**3)(c)
    array([24.])
    >>> P.polyder(c, scl=-1)  # (d/d(-x))(c)
    array([ -2.,  -6., -12.])
    >>> P.polyder(c, 2, -1)  # (d**2/d(-x)**2)(c)
    array([  6.,  24.])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Differentiate a polynomial.

    Returns the polynomial coefficients `c` differentiated `m` times along
    `axis`.  At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (the
    scaling factor is for use in a linear change of variable).  The
    argument `c` is an array of coefficients from low to high degree along
    each axis, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the polynomial ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2``
    while [[1,2],[1,2]] represents ``1 + 1*x + 2*y + 2*x*y`` if axis=0 is
    ``x`` and axis=1 is ``y``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        Array of polynomial coefficients. If c is multidimensional the
        different axis correspond to different variables with the degree
        in each axis given by the corresponding index.
    m : int, optional
        Number of derivatives taken, must be non-negative. (Default: 1)
    scl : scalar, optional
        Each differentiation is multiplied by `scl`.  The end result is
        multiplication by ``scl**m``.  This is for use in a linear change
        of variable. (Default: 1)
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which the derivative is taken. (Default: 0).
