I will provide you with the docstring for the polydiv function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.polynomial.polydiv. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Divide one polynomial by another.

    Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two polynomials `c1` / `c2`.
    The arguments are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order term
    to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of polynomial coefficients ordered from low to high.

    Returns
    -------
    [quo, rem] : ndarrays
        Of coefficient series representing the quotient and remainder.

    See Also
    --------
    polyadd, polysub, polymulx, polymul, polypow

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c1 = (1, 2, 3)
    >>> c2 = (3, 2, 1)
    >>> P.polydiv(c1, c2)
    (array([3.]), array([-8., -4.]))
    >>> P.polydiv(c2, c1)
    (array([ 0.33333333]), array([ 2.66666667,  1.33333333]))  # may vary

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Divide one polynomial by another.

    Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two polynomials `c1` / `c2`.
    The arguments are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order term
    to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents ``1 + 2*x + 3*x**2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of polynomial coefficients ordered from low to high.

    Returns
    -------
    [quo, rem] : ndarrays
        Of coefficient series representing the quotient and remainder.

    See Also
    --------
    polyadd, polysub, polymulx, polymul, polypow

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c1 = (1, 2, 3)
    >>> c2 = (3, 2, 1)
    >>> P.polydiv(c1, c2)
    (array([3.]), array([-8., -4.]))
    >>> P.polydiv(c2, c1)
    (array([ 0.33333333]), array([ 2.66666667,  1.33333333]))  # may vary
    Dividing by a constant polynomial:
    
    >>> c1 = (1, 2, 3)
    >>> c2 = (2,)
    >>> np.polynomial.polynomial.polydiv(c1, c2)
    (array([ 0.5,  1. ,  1.5]), array([0.]))
