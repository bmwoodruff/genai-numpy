I will provide you with the docstring for the polygrid2d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.polynomial.polygrid2d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Evaluate a 2-D polynomial on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * a^i * b^j

    where the points ``(a, b)`` consist of all pairs formed by taking
    `a` from `x` and `b` from `y`. The resulting points form a grid with
    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either
    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication
    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape + y.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.  If `x` or `y` is a list or
        tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))
    >>> P.polygrid2d([0, 1], [0, 1], c)
    array([[ 1.,  6.],
           [ 5., 21.]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))
    >>> P.polygrid2d([0, 1], [0, 1], c)
    array([[ 1.,  6.],
           [ 5., 21.]])

    Evaluating a polynomial on a grid of points:
    
    >>> x, y = np.ogrid[:3, :3]
    >>> c = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))
    >>> P.polygrid2d(x, y, c)
    array([[[ 1.,  4.,  9.],
             [ 5., 12., 21.],
             [ 9., 20., 33.]],
            [[ 3.,  6.,  9.],
             [ 7., 14., 21.],
             [11., 22., 33.]],
            [[ 5.,  8., 11.],
             [ 9., 16., 23.],
             [13., 24., 35.]]])

I decided to add this example because it shows how to evaluate a polynomial on a grid of points, which is a common use case for this function. The original example only showed a simple evaluation, but this example demonstrates how to use `np.ogrid` to create a grid of points and then evaluate the polynomial on that grid.

I stopped adding examples because the two examples now cover the basic usage of the function and a more advanced use case. Additional examples might be redundant or too specific, and might not add significant value to the documentation.
