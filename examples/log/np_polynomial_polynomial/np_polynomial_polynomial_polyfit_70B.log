I will provide you with the docstring for the polyfit function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.polynomial.polyfit. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Least-squares fit of a polynomial to data.

    Return the coefficients of a polynomial of degree `deg` that is the
    least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If `y` is
    1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D multiple
    fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
    coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
    The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form

    .. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * x + ... + c_n * x^n,

    where `n` is `deg`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (`M`,)
        x-coordinates of the `M` sample (data) points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (`M`,) or (`M`, `K`)
        y-coordinates of the sample points.  Several sets of sample points
        sharing the same x-coordinates can be (independently) fit with one
        call to `polyfit` by passing in for `y` a 2-D array that contains
        one data set per column.
    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
        fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
        degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit.  Singular values smaller
        than `rcond`, relative to the largest singular value, will be
        ignored.  The default value is ``len(x)*eps``, where `eps` is the
        relative precision of the platform's float type, about 2e-16 in
        most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining the nature of the return value.  When ``False``
        (the default) just the coefficients are returned; when ``True``,
        diagnostic information from the singular value decomposition (used
        to solve the fit's matrix equation) is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the weight ``w[i]`` applies to the unsquared
        residual ``y[i] - y_hat[i]`` at ``x[i]``. Ideally the weights are
        chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]`` all have the
        same variance.  When using inverse-variance weighting, use
        ``w[i] = 1/sigma(y[i])``.  The default value is None.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (`deg` + 1,) or (`deg` + 1, `K`)
        Polynomial coefficients ordered from low to high.  If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients in column `k` of `coef` represent the polynomial
        fit to the data in `y`'s `k`-th column.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if ``full == True``

        - residuals -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        - rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        - singular_values -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        - rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `numpy.linalg.lstsq`.

    Raises
    ------
    RankWarning
        Raised if the matrix in the least-squares fit is rank deficient.
        The warning is only raised if ``full == False``.  The warnings can
        be turned off by:

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', np.exceptions.RankWarning)

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the polynomial `p` that minimizes
    the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math:: E = \sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where the :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by
    setting up the (typically) over-determined matrix equation:

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected (and `full` == ``False``), a `~exceptions.RankWarning` will be
    raised.  This means that the coefficient values may be poorly determined.
    Fitting to a lower order polynomial will usually get rid of the warning
    (but may not be what you want, of course; if you have independent
    reason(s) for choosing the degree which isn't working, you may have to:
    a) reconsider those reasons, and/or b) reconsider the quality of your
    data).  The `rcond` parameter can also be set to a value smaller than
    its default, but the resulting fit may be spurious and have large
    contributions from roundoff error.

    Polynomial fits using double precision tend to "fail" at about
    (polynomial) degree 20. Fits using Chebyshev or Legendre series are
    generally better conditioned, but much can still depend on the
    distribution of the sample points and the smoothness of the data.  If
    the quality of the fit is inadequate, splines may be a good
    alternative.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> x = np.linspace(-1,1,51)  # x "data": [-1, -0.96, ..., 0.96, 1]
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> err = rng.normal(size=len(x))
    >>> y = x**3 - x + err  # x^3 - x + Gaussian noise
    >>> c, stats = P.polyfit(x,y,3,full=True)
    >>> c # c[0], c[1] approx. -1, c[2] should be approx. 0, c[3] approx. 1
    array([ 0.23111996, -1.02785049, -0.2241444 ,  1.08405657]) # may vary
    >>> stats # note the large SSR, explaining the rather poor results
    [array([48.312088]),                                        # may vary
     4,
     array([1.38446749, 1.32119158, 0.50443316, 0.28853036]),
     1.1324274851176597e-14]

    Same thing without the added noise

    >>> y = x**3 - x
    >>> c, stats = P.polyfit(x,y,3,full=True)
    >>> c # c[0], c[1] ~= -1, c[2] should be "very close to 0", c[3] ~= 1

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples

    >>> c, stats = P.polyfit(x,y,3,full=True)

     1.1324274851176597e-14]

    Same thing without the added noise

    >>> y = x**3 - x
    >>> c, stats = P.polyfit(x,y,3,full=True)
    >>> c # c[0], c[1] ~= -1, c[2] should be "very close to 0", c[3] ~= 1

    >>> stats # note the minuscule SSR
    [array([8.79579319e-31]),

    Fitting a polynomial to multiple data sets:

    >>> x = np.linspace(-1,1,51)  # x "data": [-1, -0.96, ..., 0.96, 1]
    >>> y1 = x**3 - x
    >>> y2 = x**2 + 2*x
    >>> y = np.array([y1, y2]).T
    >>> c, stats = np.polynomial.polynomial.polyfit(x,y,2,full=True)
    >>> c.shape  # c.shape == (3, 2)
    (3, 2)

I decided to add an example because the existing examples only demonstrate fitting a polynomial to a single data set. The new example shows how to fit a polynomial to multiple data sets, which is a common use case for this function.
