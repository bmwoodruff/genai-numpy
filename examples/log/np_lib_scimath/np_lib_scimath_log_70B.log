I will provide you with the docstring for the log function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.lib.scimath.log. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the natural logarithm of `x`.

    Return the "principal value" (for a description of this, see `numpy.log`)
    of :math:`log_e(x)`. For real `x > 0`, this is a real number (``log(0)``
    returns ``-inf`` and ``log(np.inf)`` returns ``inf``). Otherwise, the
    complex principle value is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       The value(s) whose log is (are) required.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or scalar
       The log of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so is `out`,
       otherwise an array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.log

    Notes
    -----
    For a log() that returns ``NAN`` when real `x < 0`, use `numpy.log`
    (note, however, that otherwise `numpy.log` and this `log` are identical,
    i.e., both return ``-inf`` for `x = 0`, ``inf`` for `x = inf`, and,
    notably, the complex principle value if ``x.imag != 0``).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.emath.log(np.exp(1))
    1.0

    Negative arguments are handled "correctly" (recall that
    ``exp(log(x)) == x`` does *not* hold for real ``x < 0``):

    >>> np.emath.log(-np.exp(1)) == (1 + np.pi * 1j)
    True

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.lib.scimath.log(np.exp(1))
    1.0

    Negative arguments are handled "correctly" (recall that
    ``exp(log(x)) == x`` does *not* hold for real ``x < 0``):

    >>> np.lib.scimath.log(-np.exp(1)) == (1 + np.pi * 1j)
    True

    Log of zero and infinity:
    
    >>> np.lib.scimath.log(0)
    -inf

    >>> np.lib.scimath.log(np.inf)
    inf
