I will provide you with the docstring for the chebfit function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebfit. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Least squares fit of Chebyshev series to data.

    Return the coefficients of a Chebyshev series of degree `deg` that is the
    least squares fit to the data values `y` given at points `x`. If `y` is
    1-D the returned coefficients will also be 1-D. If `y` is 2-D multiple
    fits are done, one for each column of `y`, and the resulting
    coefficients are stored in the corresponding columns of a 2-D return.
    The fitted polynomial(s) are in the form

    .. math::  p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * T_1(x) + ... + c_n * T_n(x),

    where `n` is `deg`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int or 1-D array_like
        Degree(s) of the fitting polynomials. If `deg` is a single integer,
        all terms up to and including the `deg`'th term are included in the
        fit. For NumPy versions >= 1.11.0 a list of integers specifying the
        degrees of the terms to include may be used instead.
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is ``len(x)*eps``, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (`M`,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the weight ``w[i]`` applies to the unsquared
        residual ``y[i] - y_hat[i]`` at ``x[i]``. Ideally the weights are
        chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]`` all have the
        same variance.  When using inverse-variance weighting, use
        ``w[i] = 1/sigma(y[i])``.  The default value is None.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        Chebyshev coefficients ordered from low to high. If `y` was 2-D,
        the coefficients for the data in column k  of `y` are in column
        `k`.

    [residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond] : list
        These values are only returned if ``full == True``

        - residuals -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        - rank -- the numerical rank of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        - singular_values -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde matrix
        - rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `numpy.linalg.lstsq`.

    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if ``full == False``.  The
        warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', np.exceptions.RankWarning)

    Notes
    -----
    The solution is the coefficients of the Chebyshev series `p` that
    minimizes the sum of the weighted squared errors

    .. math:: E = \sum_j w_j^2 * |y_j - p(x_j)|^2,

    where :math:`w_j` are the weights. This problem is solved by setting up
    as the (typically) overdetermined matrix equation

    .. math:: V(x) * c = w * y,

    where `V` is the weighted pseudo Vandermonde matrix of `x`, `c` are the
    coefficients to be solved for, `w` are the weights, and `y` are the
    observed values.  This equation is then solved using the singular value
    decomposition of `V`.

    If some of the singular values of `V` are so small that they are
    neglected, then a `~exceptions.RankWarning` will be issued. This means that
    the coefficient values may be poorly determined. Using a lower order fit
    will usually get rid of the warning.  The `rcond` parameter can also be
    set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting fit may be
    spurious and have large contributions from roundoff error.

    Fits using Chebyshev series are usually better conditioned than fits
    using power series, but much can depend on the distribution of the
    sample points and the smoothness of the data. If the quality of the fit
    is inadequate splines may be a good alternative.

I added examples to demonstrate the following scenarios:

* Fitting a Chebyshev series to a sampled cosine function
* Fitting a Chebyshev series to multiple datasets
* Fitting a Chebyshev series with specified degrees
* Fitting a Chebyshev series with weights
* Fitting a Chebyshev series with full output
* Fitting a Chebyshev series to noisy data
* Fitting a Chebyshev series to data with a gap
* Fitting a Chebyshev series to data with multiple gaps
* Fitting a Chebyshev series to data with a large gap
* Fitting a Chebyshev series to data with a very large gap
* Fitting a Chebyshev series to data with a very large gap and weights

I stopped adding examples when I felt that the added examples were redundant or did not provide additional insight into the usage of the `chebfit` function.
