I will provide you with the docstring for the chebgrid2d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebgrid2d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * T_i(a) * T_j(b),

    where the points `(a, b)` consist of all pairs formed by taking
    `a` from `x` and `b` from `y`. The resulting points form a grid with
    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either
    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication
    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape + y.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.  If `x` or `y` is a list or
        tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j is contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional Chebyshev series at points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.

Here is the updated docstring with additional examples:

    Evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * T_i(a) * T_j(b),

    where the points `(a, b)` consist of all pairs formed by taking
    `a` from `x` and `b` from `y`. The resulting points form a grid with
    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either
    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication
    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape + y.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.  If `x` or `y` is a list or
        tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j is contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional Chebyshev series at points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.

    Examples
    --------
    Evaluating a 2-D Chebyshev series:
    
    >>> x, y = np.mgrid[-1:1:5j, -1:1:5j]
    >>> c = np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebcoeff2d([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    >>> np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebgrid2d(x, y, c)

    Evaluating a 2-D Chebyshev series with multiple sets of coefficients:
    
    >>> x, y = np.mgrid[-1:1:5j, -1:1:5j]
    >>> c = np.array([[[1, 0], [0, 1]], [[1, 0], [0, 1]]])
    >>> np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebgrid2d(x, y, c)

    Evaluating a 2-D Chebyshev series with scalar inputs:
    
    >>> x, y = 0, 0
    >>> c = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    >>> np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebgrid2d(x, y, c)

I decided to add these examples because they demonstrate different use cases of the `chebgrid2d` function. The first example shows how to evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series on a grid of points. The second example demonstrates how to evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series with multiple sets of coefficients. The third example shows how to evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series with scalar inputs.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples and the new ones I added cover the main use cases of the `chebgrid2d` function. The function is relatively simple, and the examples provide a good understanding of how to use it. Adding more examples would not provide significant additional value.
