I will provide you with the docstring for the chebval2d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebval2d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series at points (x, y).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * T_i(x) * T_j(y)

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and they
    must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either `x`
    and `y` or their elements must support multiplication and addition both
    with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array a one is implicitly appended to its shape to make
    it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] + x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points ``(x, y)``,
        where `x` and `y` must have the same shape. If `x` or `y` is a list
        or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and if it isn't an ndarray it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term
        of multi-degree i,j is contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has
        dimension greater than 2 the remaining indices enumerate multiple
        sets of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional Chebyshev series at points formed
        from pairs of corresponding values from `x` and `y`.

Here is the updated docstring with additional examples:

    Evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series at points (x, y).

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(x,y) = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * T_i(x) * T_j(y)

    must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either `x`
    and `y` or their elements must support multiplication and addition both

    Parameters
    ----------

    Examples
    --------
    Evaluating a 2-D Chebyshev series:
    >>> x, y = np.mgrid[-1:1:5j, -1:1:5j]
    >>> c = np.array([[1, x, y], [1, x, y]])
    >>> np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebval2d(x, y, c)

    Evaluating a 2-D Chebyshev series with multiple sets of coefficients:
    >>> x, y = np.mgrid[-1:1:5j, -1:1:5j]
    >>> c = np.array([[[1, x, y], [1, x, y]], [[1, x, y], [1, x, y]]])
    >>> np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebval2d(x, y, c)

    Evaluating a 2-D Chebyshev series with scalar inputs:
    >>> x, y = 0.5, 0.5
    >>> c = np.array([[1, x, y], [1, x, y]])
    >>> np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebval2d(x, y, c)

I decided to add these examples because they demonstrate different ways to use the `chebval2d` function. The first example shows how to evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series with array inputs, the second example shows how to evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series with multiple sets of coefficients, and the third example shows how to evaluate a 2-D Chebyshev series with scalar inputs.

I stopped adding examples because I believe these three examples cover the main use cases of the `chebval2d` function. They demonstrate how to use the function with different types of inputs and how to handle multiple sets of coefficients.
