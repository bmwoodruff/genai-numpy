I will provide you with the docstring for the chebmul function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebmul. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Multiply one Chebyshev series by another.

    Returns the product of two Chebyshev series `c1` * `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order "term" to highest,
    e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Chebyshev series coefficients representing their product.

    See Also
    --------
    chebadd, chebsub, chebmulx, chebdiv, chebpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms
    that are not in the Chebyshev polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express
    the product as a C-series, it is typically necessary to "reproject"
    the product onto said basis set, which typically produces
    "unintuitive live" (but correct) results; see Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebmul(c1,c2) # multiplication requires "reprojection"
    array([  6.5,  12. ,  12. ,   4. ,   1.5])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    array([  6.5,  12. ,  12. ,   4. ,   1.5])
    Multiplying two identical series:
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> C.chebmul(c1,c1)
    array([  3. ,   8. ,  18. ,  12. ,   9. ,   4.5,   1.5])
