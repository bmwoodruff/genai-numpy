I will provide you with the docstring for the chebsub function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebsub. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Subtract one Chebyshev series from another.

    Returns the difference of two Chebyshev series `c1` - `c2`.  The
    sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the series ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Chebyshev series coefficients representing their difference.

    See Also
    --------
    chebadd, chebmulx, chebmul, chebdiv, chebpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Chebyshev
    series is a Chebyshev series (without having to "reproject" the result
    onto the basis set) so subtraction, just like that of "standard"
    polynomials, is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebsub(c1,c2)
    array([-2.,  0.,  2.])
    >>> C.chebsub(c2,c1) # -C.chebsub(c1,c2)
    array([ 2.,  0., -2.])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Subtract one Chebyshev series from another.

    Returns the difference of two Chebyshev series `c1` - `c2`.  The
    sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the series ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Chebyshev series coefficients representing their difference.

    See Also
    --------
    cheb, chebmulx, chebmul, chebdiv, chebpow

    onto the basis set) so subtraction, just like that of "standard"

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebsub(c1,c2)
    array([-2.,  0.,  2.])
    >>> C.chebsub(c2,c1) # -C.chebsub(c1,c2)
    array([ 2.,  0., -2.])
    Subtracting a series from itself:
    >>> c = (1,2,3)
    >>> np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebsub(c,c)
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.])

I decided to add this example because it shows the behavior of the function when subtracting a series from itself, which is a common use case. This example helps to illustrate that the function returns an array of zeros in this scenario, which can be useful for users to know.

I stopped after adding this one example because the existing examples already demonstrate the basic functionality of the function, and this additional example provides further insight into its behavior.
