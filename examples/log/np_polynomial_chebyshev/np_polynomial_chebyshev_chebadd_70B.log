I will provide you with the docstring for the chebadd function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebadd. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Add one Chebyshev series to another.

    Returns the sum of two Chebyshev series `c1` + `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to
    highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the Chebyshev series of their sum.

    See Also
    --------
    chebsub, chebmulx, chebmul, chebdiv, chebpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Chebyshev series
    is a Chebyshev series (without having to "reproject" the result onto
    the basis set) so addition, just like that of "standard" polynomials,
    is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebadd(c1,c2)
    array([4., 4., 4.])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Add one Chebyshev series to another.

    Returns the sum of two Chebyshev series `c1` + `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to
    highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the Chebyshev series of their sum.

    See Also
    --------
    chebsub, chebmulx, chebmul, chebdiv, chebpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Chebyshev series
    is a Chebyshev series (without having to "reproject" the result onto
    the basis set) so addition, just like that of "standard" polynomials,
    is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebadd(c1,c2)
    array([4., 4., 4.])

    Adding a series to itself:
    
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> C.chebadd(c1,c1)
    array([2., 4., 6.])

I decided to add the second example because it shows a simple but important use case of the `chebadd` function: adding a series to itself. This can be a common operation in certain applications, and it's useful to demonstrate how the function behaves in this scenario.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic functionality of the `chebadd` function, and the additional example provides a useful variation on this theme. Further examples might be redundant or unnecessary, and might clutter the documentation.
