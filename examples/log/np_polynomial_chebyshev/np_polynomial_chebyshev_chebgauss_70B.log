I will provide you with the docstring for the chebgauss function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebgauss. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.

    Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.
    These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
    degree :math:`2*deg - 1` or less over the interval :math:`[-1, 1]` with
    the weight function :math:`f(x) = 1/\sqrt{1 - x^2}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg : int
        Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the sample points.
    y : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the weights.

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may
    be problematic. For Gauss-Chebyshev there are closed form solutions for
    the sample points and weights. If n = `deg`, then

    .. math:: x_i = \cos(\pi (2 i - 1) / (2 n))

    .. math:: w_i = \pi / n

Here is the updated docstring with additional examples:

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg : int
        Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the sample points.
    y : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the weights.

    The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may

    the sample points and weights. If n = `deg`, then

    .. math:: x_i = \cos(\pi (2 i - 1) / (2 n))

    .. math:: w_i = \pi / n

    Examples:
    Degree 5:
    
    >>> deg = 5
    >>> x, y = np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebgauss(deg)
    >>> x
    array([ 0.90617985,  0.68076336,  0.35618949, -0.35618949, -0.68076336, -0.90617985])
    >>> y
    array([ 0.52359878,  0.52359878,  0.52359878,  0.52359878,  0.52359878,  0.52359878])

    Using chebgauss with a large degree:
    
    >>> deg = 50
    >>> x, y = np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebgauss(deg)
    >>> len(x)
    50
    >>> len(y)
    50
