I will provide you with the docstring for the chebvander function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degree.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degree `deg` and sample points
    `x`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., i] = T_i(x),

    where ``0 <= i <= deg``. The leading indices of `V` index the elements of
    `x` and the last index is the degree of the Chebyshev polynomial.

    If `c` is a 1-D array of coefficients of length ``n + 1`` and `V` is the
    matrix ``V = chebvander(x, n)``, then ``np.dot(V, c)`` and
    ``chebval(x, c)`` are the same up to roundoff.  This equivalence is
    useful both for least squares fitting and for the evaluation of a large
    number of Chebyshev series of the same degree and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128
        depending on whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is
        scalar it is converted to a 1-D array.
    deg : int
        Degree of the resulting matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    vander : ndarray
        The pseudo Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is
        ``x.shape + (deg + 1,)``, where The last index is the degree of the
        corresponding Chebyshev polynomial.  The dtype will be the same as
        the converted `x`.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128
        depending on whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is
        scalar it is converted to a 1-D array.
    deg : int
        Degree of the resulting matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    vander : ndarray
        The pseudo Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is
        ``x.shape + (deg + 1,)``, where The last index is the degree of the
        corresponding Chebyshev polynomial.  The dtype will be the same as
        the converted `x`.

    Examples
    --------
    Using the Chebyshev Vandermonde matrix to evaluate Chebyshev polynomials:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> deg = 3
    >>> v = np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander(x, deg)
    >>> v.shape
    (5, 4)
    >>> v.dtype
    dtype('float64')

    Evaluating Chebyshev polynomials with the Chebyshev Vandermonde matrix:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> deg = 3
    >>> c = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> v = np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander(x, deg-1)
    >>> np.dot(v, c)
    array([ 14.,  30.,  54.,  86., 126.])

    Creating a Chebyshev Vandermonde matrix with complex points:

    >>> x = np.array([1 + 2j, 2 + 3j, 3 + 4j, 4 + 5j, 5 + 6j])
    >>> deg = 3
    >>> v = np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander(x, deg)
    >>> v.dtype
    dtype('complex128')

    Evaluating Chebyshev polynomials with scalar points:

    >>> x = 5
    >>> deg = 3
    >>> v = np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander(x, deg)
    >>> v.shape
    (1, 4)
