I will provide you with the docstring for the chebvander3d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander3d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points ``(x, y, z)``. If `l`, `m`, `n` are the given degrees in `x`, `y`, `z`,
    then The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (m+1)(n+1)i + (n+1)j + k] = T_i(x)*T_j(y)*T_k(z),

    where ``0 <= i <= l``, ``0 <= j <= m``, and ``0 <= j <= n``.  The leading
    indices of `V` index the points ``(x, y, z)`` and the last index encodes
    the degrees of the Chebyshev polynomials.

    If ``V = chebvander3d(x, y, z, [xdeg, ydeg, zdeg])``, then the columns
    of `V` correspond to the elements of a 3-D coefficient array `c` of
    shape (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1, zdeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{000}, c_{001}, c_{002},... , c_{010}, c_{011}, c_{012},...

    and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``chebval3d(x, y, z, c)`` will be the
    same up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 3-D Chebyshev
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes will
        be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on whether
        any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to 1-D
        arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg, z_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander3d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg[1]+1)*(deg[2]+1)`.  The dtype will
        be the same as the converted `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Here is the updated docstring with additional examples:

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes will
        be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on whether
        any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to 1-D
        arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg, z_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander3d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg[1]+1)*(deg[2]+1)`.  The dtype will
        be the same as the converted `x`, `y`, and `z`.

    Examples
    --------
    Evaluating a 3-D Chebyshev series:
    >>> x, y, z = np.array([1]), np.array([2]), np.array([3])
    >>> deg = [2, 2, 2]
    >>> v = np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander3d(x, y, z, deg)
    >>> c = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],
    ...                 [[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]],
    ...                 [[19, 20, 21], [22, 23, 24], [25, 26, 27]]])
    >>> np.dot(v, c.flat)

    Using the output to evaluate a 3-D Chebyshev series at a different point:
    >>> x, y, z = np.array([4]), np.array([5]), np.array([6])
    >>> v = np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander3d(x, y, z, deg)
    >>> np.dot(v, c.flat)

    Evaluating a 3-D Chebyshev series with complex coefficients:
    >>> x, y, z = np.array([1]), np.array([2]), np.array([3])
    >>> deg = [2, 2, 2]
    >>> v = np.polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander3d(x, y, z, deg)
    >>> c = np.array([[[1 + 2j, 2 + 3j, 3 + 4j], [4 + 5j, 5 + 6j, 6 + 7j], [7 + 8j, 8 + 9j, 9 + 10j]],
    ...                 [[10 + 11j, 11 + 12j, 12 + 13j], [13 + 14j, 14 + 15j, 15 + 16j], [16 + 17j, 17 + 18j, 18 + 19j]],
    ...                 [[19 + 20j, 20 + 21j, 21 + 22j], [22 + 23j, 23 + 24j, 24 + 25j], [25 + 26j, 26 + 27j, 27 + 28j]]])
    >>> np.dot(v, c.flat)

I decided to add these examples because they demonstrate how to use the `chebvander3d` function to evaluate a 3-D Chebyshev series at different points, and how to handle complex coefficients. These examples provide a clear illustration of the function's usage and can help users understand how to apply it in their own work.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples and the new ones I added provide a comprehensive understanding of the function's behavior and usage. Additional examples would likely be redundant or provide little additional insight.
