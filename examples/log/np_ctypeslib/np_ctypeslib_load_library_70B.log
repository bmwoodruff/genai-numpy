I will provide you with the docstring for the load_library function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ctypeslib.load_library. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        It is possible to load a library using

        >>> lib = ctypes.cdll[<full_path_name>] # doctest: +SKIP

        But there are cross-platform considerations, such as library file extensions,
        plus the fact Windows will just load the first library it finds with that name.
        NumPy supplies the load_library function as a convenience.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.20.0
            Allow libname and loader_path to take any
            :term:`python:path-like object`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        libname : path-like
            Name of the library, which can have 'lib' as a prefix,
            but without an extension.
        loader_path : path-like
            Where the library can be found.

        Returns
        -------
        ctypes.cdll[libpath] : library object
           A ctypes library object

        Raises
        ------
        OSError
            If there is no library with the expected extension, or the
            library is defective and cannot be loaded.
