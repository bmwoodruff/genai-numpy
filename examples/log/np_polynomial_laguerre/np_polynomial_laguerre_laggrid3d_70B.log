I will provide you with the docstring for the laggrid3d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.laguerre.laggrid3d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Evaluate a 3-D Laguerre series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b,c) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * L_i(a) * L_j(b) * L_k(c)

    where the points ``(a, b, c)`` consist of all triples formed by taking
    `a` from `x`, `b` from `y`, and `c` from `z`. The resulting points form
    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in
    the third.

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if they
    are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In
    either case, either `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support
    multiplication and addition both with themselves and with the elements
    of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than three dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape + y.shape + z.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`, `y`, or `z` is a
        list or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is
        left unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a
        scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Evaluate a 3-D Laguerre series on the Cartesian product of x, y, and z.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b,c) = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * L_i(a) * L_j(b) * L_k(c)

    where the points ``(a, b, c)`` consist of all triples formed by taking
    `a` from `x`, `b` from `y`, and `c` from `z`. The resulting points form
    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in
    the third.

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if they
    are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In
    either case, either `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support
    multiplication and addition both with themselves and with the elements
    of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than three dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape + y.shape + z.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`, `y`, or `z` is a
        list or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is
        left unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a
        scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.
