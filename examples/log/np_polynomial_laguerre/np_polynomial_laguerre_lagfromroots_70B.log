I will provide you with the docstring for the lagfromroots function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.laguerre.lagfromroots. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Generate a Laguerre series with given roots.

    The function returns the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    in Laguerre form, where the :math:`r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.
    If a zero has multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times.
    For instance, if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of
    multiplicity 2, then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The
    roots can appear in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... +  c_n * L_n(x)

    The coefficient of the last term is not generally 1 for monic
    polynomials in Laguerre form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of coefficients.  If all roots are real then `out` is a
        real array, if some of the roots are complex, then `out` is complex
        even if all the coefficients in the result are real (see Examples
        below).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagfromroots, lagval
    >>> coef = lagfromroots((-1, 0, 1))
    >>> lagval((-1, 0, 1), coef)
    array([0.,  0.,  0.])
    >>> coef = lagfromroots((-1j, 1j))
    >>> lagval((-1j, 1j), coef)
    array([0.+0.j, 0.+0.j])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagfromroots, lagval
    >>> coef = lagfromroots((-1, 0, 1))
    >>> lagval((-1, 0, 1), coef)
    array([0.,  0.,  0.])
    >>> coef = lagfromroots((-1j, 1j))
    >>> lagval((-1j, 1j), coef)
    array([0.+0.j, 0.+0.j])

    Roots with multiplicity:
    
    >>> roots = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
    >>> coef = np.polynomial.laguerre.lagfromroots(roots)
    >>> coef
    array([ 8., -36., 54., -36.,  9.])
