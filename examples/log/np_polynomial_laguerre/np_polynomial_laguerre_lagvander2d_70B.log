I will provide you with the docstring for the lagvander2d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.laguerre.lagvander2d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points ``(x, y)``. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (deg[1] + 1)*i + j] = L_i(x) * L_j(y),

    where ``0 <= i <= deg[0]`` and ``0 <= j <= deg[1]``. The leading indices of
    `V` index the points ``(x, y)`` and the last index encodes the degrees of
    the Laguerre polynomials.

    If ``V = lagvander2d(x, y, [xdeg, ydeg])``, then the columns of `V`
    correspond to the elements of a 2-D coefficient array `c` of shape
    (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{02} ... , c_{10}, c_{11}, c_{12} ...

    and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``lagval2d(x, y, c)`` will be the same
    up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 2-D Laguerre
    series of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes
        will be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on
        whether any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to
        1-D arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander2d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg[1]+1)`.  The dtype will be the same
        as the converted `x` and `y`.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> x = np.array([0])
    >>> y = np.array([2])
    >>> lagvander2d(x, y, [2, 1])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagvander2d
    >>> x = np.array([0])
    >>> y = np.array([2])
    >>> lagvander2d(x, y, [2, 1])
    array([[ 1., -1.,  1., -1.,  1., -1.]])
    
    Different degrees for x and y:
    
    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2])
    >>> y = np.array([2, 3, 4])
    >>> lagvander2d(x, y, [3, 2])
    array([[ 1., -1.,  1., -1.,  1.,  1., -1.,  1., -1.],
           [ 1., -2.,  4., -2.,  1.,  2., -4.,  2., -1.],
           [ 1., -3.,  9., -3.,  1.,  3., -9.,  3., -1.]])
