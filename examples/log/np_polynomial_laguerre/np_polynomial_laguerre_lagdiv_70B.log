I will provide you with the docstring for the lagdiv function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.laguerre.lagdiv. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Divide one Laguerre series by another.

    Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two Laguerre series
    `c1` / `c2`.  The arguments are sequences of coefficients from lowest
    order "term" to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series
    ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    [quo, rem] : ndarrays
        Of Laguerre series coefficients representing the quotient and
        remainder.

    See Also
    --------
    lagadd, lagsub, lagmulx, lagmul, lagpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) division of one Laguerre series by another
    results in quotient and remainder terms that are not in the Laguerre
    polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express these results as a Laguerre
    series, it is necessary to "reproject" the results onto the Laguerre
    basis set, which may produce "unintuitive" (but correct) results; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagdiv
    >>> lagdiv([  8., -13.,  38., -51.,  36.], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([1., 2., 3.]), array([0.]))
    >>> lagdiv([  9., -12.,  38., -51.,  36.], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([1., 2., 3.]), array([1., 1.]))

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagdiv
    >>> lagdiv([  8., -13.,  38., -51.,  36.], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([1., 2., 3.]), array([0.]))
    >>> lagdiv([  9., -12.,  38., -51.,  36.], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([1., 2., 3.]), array([1., 1.]))
    Dividing a Laguerre series by itself:
    
    >>> lagdiv([0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([1., 0., 0.]), array([0., 0., 0.]))
