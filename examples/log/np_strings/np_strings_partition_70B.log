I will provide you with the docstring for the partition function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.strings.partition. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Partition each element in ``a`` around ``sep``.

    For each element in ``a``, split the element at the first
    occurrence of ``sep``, and return a 3-tuple containing the part
    before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after
    the separator. If the separator is not found, the first item of
    the tuple will contain the whole string, and the second and third
    ones will be the empty string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
        Input array
    sep : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
        Separator to split each string element in ``a``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : 3-tuple:
        - array with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype with the
          part before the separator
        - array with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype with the
          separator
        - array with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype with the
          part after the separator

    See Also
    --------
    str.partition

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array(["Numpy is nice"])
    >>> np.strings.partition(x, " ")
    (array(['Numpy'], dtype='<U5'),
     array([' '], dtype='<U1'),
     array(['is nice'], dtype='<U8'))

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Partition each element in ``a`` around ``sep``.

    For each element in ``a``, split the element at the first
    occurrence of ``sep``, and return a 3-tuple containing the part
    before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after
    the separator. If the separator is not found, the first item of
    the tuple will contain the whole string, and the second and third
    ones will be the empty string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
        Input array
    sep : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
        Separator to split each string element in ``a``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : 3-tuple:
        - array with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype with the
          part before the separator
        - array with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype with the
          separator
        - array with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype with the
          part after the separator

    --------
    str.partition

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array(["Numpy is nice"])
    >>> np.strings.partition(x, " ")
    (array(['Numpy'], dtype='<U5'),
     array([' '], dtype='<U1'),
     array(['is nice'], dtype='<U8'))

    Multiple strings with different separators:
    
    >>> x = np.array(["Numpy is nice!", "Python is great"])
    >>> np.strings.partition(x, [" ", " "])
    (array(['Numpy', 'Python'], dtype='<U5'),
     array([' ', ' '], dtype='<U1'),
     array(['is nice!', 'is great'], dtype='<U8'))
