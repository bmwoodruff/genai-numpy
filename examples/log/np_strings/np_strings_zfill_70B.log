I will provide you with the docstring for the zfill function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.strings.zfill. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the numeric string left-filled with zeros. A leading
    sign prefix (``+``/``-``) is handled by inserting the padding
    after the sign character rather than before.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype

    width : array_like, with any integer dtype
        Width of string to left-fill elements in `a`.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Output array of ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype,
        depending on input type

    --------
    str.zfill

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.strings.zfill(['1', '-1', '+1'], 3)
    array(['001', '-01', '+01'], dtype='<U3')

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.strings.zfill(['1', '-1', '+1'], 3)
    array(['001', '-01', '+01'], dtype='<U3')

    Single string example:
    
    >>> np.strings.zfill('1', 3)
    array('001', dtype='<U3')

I decided to add an example that demonstrates the function's behavior when given a single string input, rather than a list of strings. This example helps to clarify how the function works in a simpler case.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the function's behavior with a list of strings, including those with a leading sign prefix. The additional example I added provides further clarity, but it's likely that most users will understand the function's behavior after seeing these two examples.
