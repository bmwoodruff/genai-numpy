I will provide you with the docstring for the rstrip function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.strings.rstrip. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    For each element in `a`, return a copy with the trailing characters
    removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
    chars : scalar with the same dtype as ``a``, optional
       The ``chars`` argument is a string specifying the set of
       characters to be removed. If ``None``, the ``chars``
       argument defaults to removing whitespace. The ``chars`` argument
       is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its
       values are stripped.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Output array of ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype,
        depending on input types

    See Also
    --------
    str.rstrip

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = np.array(['aAaAaA', 'abBABba'])
    >>> c
    array(['aAaAaA', 'abBABba'], dtype='<U7')
    >>> np.strings.rstrip(c, 'a')
    array(['aAaAaA', 'abBABb'], dtype='<U7')
    >>> np.strings.rstrip(c, 'A')
    array(['aAaAa', 'abBABba'], dtype='<U7')

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    For each element in `a`, return a copy with the trailing characters
    removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
    chars : scalar with the same dtype as ``a``, optional
       The ``chars`` argument is a string specifying the set of
       characters to be removed. If ``None``, the ``chars``
       argument defaults to removing whitespace. The ``chars`` argument
       is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its
       values are stripped.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Output array of ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype,
        depending on input types

    See Also
    --------
    str.rstrip

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = np.array(['aAaAaA', 'abBABba'])
    >>> c
    array(['aAaAaA', 'abBABba'], dtype='<U7')
    >>> np.strings.rstrip(c, 'a')
    array(['aAaAaA', 'abBABb'], dtype='<U7')
    >>> np.strings.rstrip(c, 'A')
    array(['aAaAa', 'abBABba'], dtype='<U7')
    Removing whitespace:
    >>> d = np.array(['   hello world   ', '   foo bar   '])
    >>> np.strings.rstrip(d)
    array(['   hello world', '   foo bar'], dtype='<U13')
