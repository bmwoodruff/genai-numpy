I will provide you with the docstring for the rpartition function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.strings.rpartition. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Partition (split) each element around the right-most separator.

    For each element in ``a``, split the element at the last
    occurrence of ``sep``, and return a 3-tuple containing the part
    before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after
    the separator. If the separator is not found, the third item of
    the tuple will contain the whole string, and the first and second
    ones will be the empty string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
        Input array
    sep : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
        Separator to split each string element in ``a``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : 3-tuple:
        - array with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype with the
          part before the separator
        - array with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype with the
          separator
        - array with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype with the
          part after the separator

    str.rpartition

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array(['aAaAaA', '  aA  ', 'abBABba'])
    >>> np.strings.rpartition(a, 'A')
    (array(['aAaAa', '  a', 'abB'], dtype='<U5'),
     array(['A', 'A', 'A'], dtype='<U1'),
     array(['', '  ', 'Bba'], dtype='<U3'))

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array(['aAaAaA', '  aA  ', 'abBABba'])
    >>> np.strings.rpartition(a, 'A')
    (array(['aAaAa', '  a', 'abB'], dtype='<U5'),
     array(['A', 'A', 'A'], dtype='<U1'),
     array(['', '  ', 'Bba'], dtype='<U3'))

    Case where separator is not found:
    >>> a = np.array(['aAaAaA', '  aA  ', 'abBABba'])
    >>> np.strings.rpartition(a, 'Z')
    (array(['', '', ''], dtype='<U0'),
     array(['', '', ''], dtype='<U0'),
     array(['aAaAaA', '  aA  ', 'abBABba'], dtype='<U7>')

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the case where the separator is not found in any of the strings. This is an important edge case that users should be aware of, as it can affect the output of the function.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic functionality of the `rpartition` function, and the additional example I added covers an important edge case. With these two examples, users should have a good understanding of how the function works in different scenarios.
