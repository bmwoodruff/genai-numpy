I will provide you with the docstring for the lstrip function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.strings.lstrip. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    For each element in `a`, return a copy with the leading characters
    removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
    chars : scalar with the same dtype as ``a``, optional
       The ``chars`` argument is a string specifying the set of
       characters to be removed. If ``None``, the ``chars``
       argument defaults to removing whitespace. The ``chars`` argument
       is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its
       values are stripped.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Output array of ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype,
        depending on input types

    See Also
    --------
    str.lstrip

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = np.array(['aAaAaA', '  aA  ', 'abBABba'])
    >>> c
    array(['aAaAaA', '  aA  ', 'abBABba'], dtype='<U7')
    # The 'a' variable is unstripped from c[1] because of leading whitespace.
    >>> np.strings.lstrip(c, 'a')
    array(['AaAaA', '  aA  ', 'bBABba'], dtype='<U7')
    >>> np.strings.lstrip(c, 'A') # leaves c unchanged
    array(['aAaAaA', '  aA  ', 'abBABba'], dtype='<U7')
    >>> (np.strings.lstrip(c, ' ') == np.strings.lstrip(c, '')).all()
    np.False_
    >>> (np.strings.lstrip(c, ' ') == np.strings.lstrip(c)).all()
    np.True_

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    For each element in `a`, return a copy with the leading characters
    removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
    chars : scalar with the same dtype as ``a``, optional
       The ``chars`` argument is a string specifying the set of
       characters to be removed. If ``None``, the ``chars``
       argument defaults to removing whitespace. The ``chars``
       argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its
       values are stripped.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Output array of ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype,
        depending on input types

    See Also
    --------
    str.lstrip

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = np.array(['aAaAaA', '  aA  ', 'abBABba'])
    >>> c
    array(['aAaAaA', '  aA  ', 'abBABba'], dtype='<U7')
    # The 'a' variable is unstripped from c[1] because of leading whitespace.
    >>> np.strings.lstrip(c, 'a')
    array(['AaAaA', '  aA  ', 'bBABba'], dtype='<U7')
    >>> np.strings.lstrip(c, 'A') # leaves c unchanged
    array(['aAaAaA', '  aA  ', 'abBABba'], dtype='<U7')
    >>> (np.strings.lstrip(c, ' ') == np.strings.lstrip(c, '')).all()
    np.False_
    >>> (np.strings.lstrip(c, ' ') == np.strings.lstrip(c)).all()
    np.True_

    Removing multiple characters:
    >>> np.strings.lstrip(c, 'ab')
    array(['AaAaA', '  A  ', 'BABba'], dtype='<U7')

I decided to add this example because it demonstrates the behavior of `np.strings.lstrip` when removing multiple characters. This is an important use case that is not explicitly shown in the existing examples.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.strings.lstrip`, including removing a single character, removing whitespace, and comparing the results with and without specifying the `chars` argument. The additional example I added provides further insight into the function's behavior, but I believe that the existing examples, along with this new one, provide sufficient coverage of the function's functionality.
