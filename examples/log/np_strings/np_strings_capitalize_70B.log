I will provide you with the docstring for the capitalize function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.strings.capitalize. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return a copy of ``a`` with only the first character of each element
    capitalized.

    Calls :meth:`str.capitalize` element-wise.

    For byte strings, this method is locale-dependent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
        Input array of strings to capitalize.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Output array of ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype,
        depending on input types

    --------
    str.capitalize

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = np.array(['a1b2','1b2a','b2a1','2a1b'],'S4'); c
    array(['a1b2', '1b2a', 'b2a1', '2a1b'],
        dtype='|S4')
    >>> np.strings.capitalize(c)
    array(['A1b2', '1b2a', 'B2a1', '2a1b'],
        dtype='|S4')

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return a copy of ``a`` with only the first character of each element
    capitalized.

    Calls :meth:`str.capitalize` element-wise.

    For byte strings, this method is locale-dependent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like, with ``StringDType``, ``bytes_``, or ``str_`` dtype
        Input array of strings to capitalize.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Output array of ``StringDType``, ``bytes_`` or ``str_`` dtype,
        depending on input types

    See Also
    --------
    str.capitalize

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = np.array(['a1b2','1b2a','b2a1','2a1b'],'S4'); c
    array(['a1b2', '1b2a', 'b2a1', '2a1b'],
        dtype='|S4')
    >>> np.strings.capitalize(c)
    array(['A1b2', '1b2a', 'B2a1', '2a1b'],
        dtype='|S4')

    Unicode strings:
    
    >>> c = np.array(['ä1b2','1b2ä','b2ä1','2ä1b'],'U4'); c
    array(['ä1b2', '1b2ä', 'b2ä1', '2ä1b'],
        dtype='<U4')
    >>> np.strings.capitalize(c)
    array(['Ä1b2', '1b2ä', 'B2ä1', '2ä1b'],
        dtype='<U4')

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the behavior of `np.strings.capitalize` with Unicode strings, as the initial examples only showed its behavior with byte strings. This additional example helps to clarify how the function handles Unicode characters.

I stopped after adding one example because the initial examples already demonstrated the basic functionality of the `np.strings.capitalize` function, and the additional example I added covered a specific edge case (Unicode strings). Further examples would likely be redundant or not provide significant additional insight into the function's behavior.
