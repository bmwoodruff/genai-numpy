I will provide you with the docstring for the fft function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fft.fft. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the one-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform.

    This function computes the one-dimensional *n*-point discrete Fourier
    Transform (DFT) with the efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    algorithm [CT].

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output.
        If `n` is smaller than the length of the input, the input is cropped.
        If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given,
        the length of the input along the axis specified by `axis` is used.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last axis is
        used.
    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
        is scaled and with what normalization factor.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

            The "backward", "forward" values were added.
    out : complex ndarray, optional
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should be
        of the appropriate shape and dtype.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        If `axis` is not a valid axis of `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.fft : for definition of the DFT and conventions used.
    ifft : The inverse of `fft`.
    fft2 : The two-dimensional FFT.
    fftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT.
    rfftn : The *n*-dimensional FFT of real input.
    fftfreq : Frequency bins for given FFT parameters.

    Notes
    -----
    FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) refers to a way the discrete Fourier
    Transform (DFT) can be calculated efficiently, by using symmetries in the
    calculated terms.  The symmetry is highest when `n` is a power of 2, and
    the transform is therefore most efficient for these sizes.

    The DFT is defined, with the conventions used in this implementation, in
    the documentation for the `numpy.fft` module.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.fft.fft(np.exp(2j * np.pi * np.arange(8) / 8))
    array([-2.33486982e-16+1.14423775e-17j,  8.00000000e+00-1.25557246e-15j,
            2.33486982e-16+2.33486982e-16j,  0.00000000e+00+1.22464680e-16j,
           -1.14423775e-17+2.33486982e-16j,  0.00000000e+00+5.20784380e-16j,
            1.14423775e-17+1.14423775e-17j,  0.00000000e+00+1.22464680e-16j])

    In this example, real input has an FFT which is Hermitian, i.e., symmetric
    in the real part and anti-symmetric in the imaginary part, as described in
    the `numpy.fft` documentation:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> t = np.arange(256)
    >>> sp = np.fft.fft(np.sin(t))
    >>> freq = np.fft.fftfreq(t.shape[-1])
    >>> plt.plot(freq, sp.real, freq, sp.imag)
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>, <matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.show()

    In this example, real input has an FFT which is Hermitian, i.e., symmetric
    in the real part and anti-symmetric in the imaginary part, as described in
    the `numpy.fft` documentation:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> t = np.arange(256)
    >>> sp = np.fft.fft(np.sin(t))
    >>> freq = np.fft.fftfreq(t.shape[-1])
    >>> plt.plot(freq, sp.real, freq, sp.imag)
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>, <matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.show()

    FFT of a complex signal:

    >>> x = np.random.rand(1024) + 1j * np.random.rand(1024)
    >>> fft_out = np.fft.fft(x)

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the FFT of a complex signal, as the existing examples only show the FFT of real signals. This example helps to illustrate the behavior of the FFT function when dealing with complex inputs.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the FFT function, and the additional example provides a new perspective on the function's behavior.
