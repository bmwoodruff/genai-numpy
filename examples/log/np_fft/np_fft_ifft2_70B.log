I will provide you with the docstring for the ifft2 function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fft.ifft2. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the 2-dimensional inverse discrete Fourier Transform.

    This function computes the inverse of the 2-dimensional discrete Fourier
    Transform over any number of axes in an M-dimensional array by means of
    the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  In other words, ``ifft2(fft2(a)) == a``
    to within numerical accuracy.  By default, the inverse transform is
    computed over the last two axes of the input array.

    The input, analogously to `ifft`, should be ordered in the same way as is
    returned by `fft2`, i.e. it should have the term for zero frequency
    in the low-order corner of the two axes, the positive frequency terms in
    the first half of these axes, the term for the Nyquist frequency in the
    middle of the axes and the negative frequency terms in the second half of
    both axes, in order of decreasingly negative frequency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, can be complex.
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape (length of each axis) of the output (``s[0]`` refers to axis 0,
        ``s[1]`` to axis 1, etc.).  This corresponds to `n` for ``ifft(x, n)``.
        Along each axis, if the given shape is smaller than that of the input,
        the input is cropped. If it is larger, the input is padded with zeros.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0

            If it is ``-1``, the whole input is used (no padding/trimming).

        If `s` is not given, the shape of the input along the axes specified
        by `axes` is used.  See notes for issue on `ifft` zero padding.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            If `s` is not ``None``, `axes` must not be ``None`` either.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            `s` must contain only ``int`` s, not ``None`` values. ``None``
            values currently mean that the default value for ``n`` is used
            in the corresponding 1-D transform, but this behaviour is
            deprecated.

    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        Axes over which to compute the FFT.  If not given, the last two
        axes are used.  A repeated index in `axes` means the transform over
        that axis is performed multiple times.  A one-element sequence means
        that a one-dimensional FFT is performed. Default: ``(-2, -1)``.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            If `s` is specified, the corresponding `axes` to be transformed
            must not be ``None``.

    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
        is scaled and with what normalization factor.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

            The "backward", "forward" values were added.

    out : complex ndarray, optional
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should be
        of the appropriate shape and dtype for all axes (and hence is
        incompatible with passing in all but the trivial ``s``).

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axes
        indicated by `axes`, or the last two axes if `axes` is not given.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `s` and `axes` have different length, or `axes` not given and
        ``len(s) != 2``.
    IndexError
        If an element of `axes` is larger than than the number of axes of `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.fft : Overall view of discrete Fourier transforms, with definitions
         and conventions used.
    fft2 : The forward 2-dimensional FFT, of which `ifft2` is the inverse.
    ifftn : The inverse of the *n*-dimensional FFT.
    fft : The one-dimensional FFT.
    ifft : The one-dimensional inverse FFT.

    Notes
    -----
    `ifft2` is just `ifftn` with a different default for `axes`.

    See `ifftn` for details and a plotting example, and `numpy.fft` for
    definition and conventions used.

    Zero-padding, analogously with `ifft`, is performed by appending zeros to
    the input along the specified dimension.  Although this is the common
    approach, it might lead to surprising results.  If another form of zero
    padding is desired, it must be performed before `ifft2` is called.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = 4 * np.eye(4)
    >>> np.fft.ifft2(a)
    array([[1.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j], # may vary
           [0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  1.+0.j],
           [0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  1.+0.j,  0.+0.j],
           [0.+0.j,  1.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = 4 * np.eye(4)
    >>> np.fft.ifft2(a)
    array([[1.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j], # may vary
           [0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  1.+0.j],
           [0.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  1.+0.j,  0.+0.j],
           [0.+0.j,  1.+0.j,  0.+0.j,  0.+0.j]])

    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3, 3))
    >>> a[1, 1, 1] = 1
    >>> np.fft.ifft2(a, s=(3, 3), axes=(1, 2))
