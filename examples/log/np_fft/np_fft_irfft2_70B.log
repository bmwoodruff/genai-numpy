I will provide you with the docstring for the irfft2 function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fft.irfft2. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Computes the inverse of `rfft2`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The input array
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape of the real output to the inverse FFT.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0

            If it is ``-1``, the whole input is used (no padding/trimming).

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            If `s` is not ``None``, `axes` must not be ``None`` either.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            `s` must contain only ``int`` s, not ``None`` values. ``None``
            values currently mean that the default value for ``n`` is used
            in the corresponding 1-D transform, but this behaviour is
            deprecated.

    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        The axes over which to compute the inverse fft.
        Default: ``(-2, -1)``, the last two axes.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            If `s` is specified, the corresponding `axes` to be transformed
            must not be ``None``.

    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
        is scaled and with what normalization factor.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

            The "backward", "forward" values were added.

    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should be
        of the appropriate shape and dtype for the last transformation.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The result of the inverse real 2-D FFT.

    See Also
    --------
    rfft2 : The forward two-dimensional FFT of real input,
            of which `irfft2` is the inverse.
    rfft : The one-dimensional FFT for real input.
    irfft : The inverse of the one-dimensional FFT of real input.
    irfftn : Compute the inverse of the N-dimensional FFT of real input.

    Notes
    -----
    This is really `irfftn` with different defaults.
    For more details see `irfftn`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.mgrid[:5, :5][0]
    >>> A = np.fft.rfft2(a)
    >>> np.fft.irfft2(A, s=a.shape)
    array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
           [2., 2., 2., 2., 2.],
           [3., 3., 3., 3., 3.],
           [4., 4., 4., 4., 4.]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Computes the inverse of `rfft2`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The input array
    s : sequence of ints, optional
        Shape of the real output to the inverse FFT.

            If it is ``-1``, the whole input is used (no padding/trimming).

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            If `s` is not ``None``, `axes` must not be ``None`` either.

        .. deprecated:: 2.0

            `s` must contain only ``int`` s, not ``None`` values. ``None``
            values currently mean that the default value for ``n`` is used
            in the corresponding 1-D transform, but this behaviour is
            deprecated.

    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        The axes over which to compute the inverse fft.
        Default: ``(-2, -1)``, the last two axes.

            must not be ``None``.

    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms

    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should be
