I will provide you with the docstring for the fftshift function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fft.fftshift. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Shift the zero-frequency component to the center of the spectrum.

    This function swaps half-spaces for all axes listed (defaults to all).
    Note that ``y[0]`` is the Nyquist component only if ``len(x)`` is even.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array.
    axes : int or shape tuple, optional
        Axes over which to shift.  Default is None, which shifts all axes.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The shifted array.

    See Also
    --------
    ifftshift : The inverse of `fftshift`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(10, 0.1)
    >>> freqs
    array([ 0.,  1.,  2., ..., -3., -2., -1.])
    >>> np.fft.fftshift(freqs)
    array([-5., -4., -3., -2., -1.,  0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.])

    Shift the zero-frequency component only along the second axis:

    >>> freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(9, d=1./9).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> freqs
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
           [ 3.,  4., -4.],
           [-3., -2., -1.]])
    >>> np.fft.fftshift(freqs, axes=(1,))
    array([[ 2.,  0.,  1.],
           [-4.,  3.,  4.],
           [-1., -3., -2.]])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(10, 0.1)
    >>> freqs
    array([ 0.,  1.,  2., ..., -3., -2., -1.])
    >>> np.fft.fftshift(freqs)
    array([-5., -4., -3., -2., -1.,  0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.])

    Shift the zero-frequency component only along the second axis:

    >>> freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(9, d=1./9).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> freqs
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
           [ 3.,  4., -4.],
           [-3., -2., -1.]])
    >>> np.fft.fftshift(freqs, axes=(1,))
    array([[ 2.,  0.,  1.],
           [-4.,  3.,  4.],
           [-1., -3., -2.]])

    Shift the zero-frequency component for a 3D array:

    >>> freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(8, 0.1).reshape(2, 2, 2)
    >>> freqs
    array([[[ 0.,  1.],
             [ 2.,  3.]],

            [[ 4.,  5.],
             [ 6.,  7.]]])

    >>> np.fft.fftshift(freqs, axes=(0, 2))
    array([[[ 7.,  6.],
             [ 5.,  4.]],

            [[ 3.,  2.],
             [ 1.,  0.]]])

I decided to add the third example because the existing examples only demonstrate the use of `fftshift` on 1D and 2D arrays. The third example shows how to use `fftshift` on a 3D array, which can be useful for users who work with higher-dimensional data. I stopped after adding this example because it covers a new scenario that was not previously demonstrated, and the existing examples already provide a good understanding of how the function works.
