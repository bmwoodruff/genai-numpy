I will provide you with the docstring for the ihfft function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fft.ihfft. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the inverse FFT of a signal that has Hermitian symmetry.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the inverse FFT, the number of points along
        transformation axis in the input to use.  If `n` is smaller than
        the length of the input, the input is cropped.  If it is larger,
        the input is padded with zeros. If `n` is not given, the length of
        the input along the axis specified by `axis` is used.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the inverse FFT. If not given, the last
        axis is used.
    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
        is scaled and with what normalization factor.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

            The "backward", "forward" values were added.

    out : complex ndarray, optional
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should be
        of the appropriate shape and dtype.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.
        The length of the transformed axis is ``n//2 + 1``.

    --------
    hfft, irfft

    Notes
    -----
    `hfft`/`ihfft` are a pair analogous to `rfft`/`irfft`, but for the
    opposite case: here the signal has Hermitian symmetry in the time
    domain and is real in the frequency domain. So here it's `hfft` for
    which you must supply the length of the result if it is to be odd:

    * even: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2)) == a``, within roundoff error,
    * odd: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 1)) == a``, within roundoff error.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> spectrum = np.array([ 15, -4, 0, -1, 0, -4])
    >>> np.fft.ifft(spectrum)
    array([1.+0.j,  2.+0.j,  3.+0.j,  4.+0.j,  3.+0.j,  2.+0.j]) # may vary
    >>> np.fft.ihfft(spectrum)
    array([ 1.-0.j,  2.-0.j,  3.-0.j,  4.-0.j]) # may vary

    >>> np.fft.ihfft(spectrum)
    array([ 1.-0.j,  2.-0.j,  3.-0.j,  4.-0.j]) # may vary

    Using ihfft with a 2D array:
    >>> spectrum = np.array([[ 15, -4, 0, -1, 0, -4], [ 15, -4, 0, -1, 0, -4]])
    >>> np.fft.ihfft(spectrum, axis=0)
    array([[ 1.-0.j,  2.-0.j,  3.-0.j,  4.-0.j],
           [ 1.-0.j,  2.-0.j,  3.-0.j,  4.-0.j]]) # may vary
