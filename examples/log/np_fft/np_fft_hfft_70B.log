I will provide you with the docstring for the hfft function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fft.hfft. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the FFT of a signal that has Hermitian symmetry, i.e., a real
    spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The input array.
    n : int, optional
        Length of the transformed axis of the output. For `n` output
        points, ``n//2 + 1`` input points are necessary.  If the input is
        longer than this, it is cropped.  If it is shorter than this, it is
        padded with zeros.  If `n` is not given, it is taken to be ``2*(m-1)``
        where ``m`` is the length of the input along the axis specified by
        `axis`.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the FFT. If not given, the last
        axis is used.
    norm : {"backward", "ortho", "forward"}, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

        Normalization mode (see `numpy.fft`). Default is "backward".
        Indicates which direction of the forward/backward pair of transforms
        is scaled and with what normalization factor.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

            The "backward", "forward" values were added.

    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the result will be placed in this array. It should be
        of the appropriate shape and dtype.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The truncated or zero-padded input, transformed along the axis
        indicated by `axis`, or the last one if `axis` is not specified.
        The length of the transformed axis is `n`, or, if `n` is not given,
        ``2*m - 2`` where ``m`` is the length of the transformed axis of
        the input. To get an odd number of output points, `n` must be
        specified, for instance as ``2*m - 1`` in the typical case,

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        If `axis` is not a valid axis of `a`.

    See also
    --------
    rfft : Compute the one-dimensional FFT for real input.
    ihfft : The inverse of `hfft`.

    Notes
    -----
    `hfft`/`ihfft` are a pair analogous to `rfft`/`irfft`, but for the
    opposite case: here the signal has Hermitian symmetry in the time
    domain and is real in the frequency domain. So here it's `hfft` for
    which you must supply the length of the result if it is to be odd.

    * even: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 2)) == a``, within roundoff error,
    * odd: ``ihfft(hfft(a, 2*len(a) - 1)) == a``, within roundoff error.

    The correct interpretation of the hermitian input depends on the length of
    the original data, as given by `n`. This is because each input shape could
    correspond to either an odd or even length signal. By default, `hfft`
    assumes an even output length which puts the last entry at the Nyquist
    frequency; aliasing with its symmetric counterpart. By Hermitian symmetry,
    the value is thus treated as purely real. To avoid losing information, the
    shape of the full signal **must** be given.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> signal = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2])
    >>> np.fft.fft(signal)
    array([15.+0.j,  -4.+0.j,   0.+0.j,  -1.-0.j,   0.+0.j,  -4.+0.j]) # may vary
    >>> np.fft.hfft(signal[:4]) # Input first half of signal
    array([15.,  -4.,   0.,  -1.,   0.,  -4.])
    >>> np.fft.hfft(signal, 6)  # Input entire signal and truncate
    array([15.,  -4.,   0.,  -1.,   0.,  -4.])


    >>> signal = np.array([[1, 1.j], [-1.j, 2]])
    >>> np.conj(signal.T) - signal   # check Hermitian symmetry
    array([[ 0.-0.j,  -0.+0.j], # may vary
           [ 0.+0.j,  0.-0.j]])
    >>> freq_spectrum = np.fft.hfft(signal)
    >>> freq_spectrum
    array([[ 1.,  1.],
           [ 2., -2.]])

    array([15.,  -4.,   0.,  -1.,   0.,  -4.])
    >>> np.fft.hfft(signal, 6)  # Input entire signal and truncate
    array([15.,  -4.,   0.,  -1.,   0.,  -4.])
