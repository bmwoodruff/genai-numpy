I will provide you with the docstring for the ifftshift function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fft.ifftshift. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    The inverse of `fftshift`. Although identical for even-length `x`, the
    functions differ by one sample for odd-length `x`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array.
    axes : int or shape tuple, optional
        Axes over which to calculate.  Defaults to None, which shifts all axes.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The shifted array.

    See Also
    --------
    fftshift : Shift zero-frequency component to the center of the spectrum.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(9, d=1./9).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> freqs
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
           [ 3.,  4., -4.],
           [-3., -2., -1.]])
    >>> np.fft.ifftshift(np.fft.fftshift(freqs))
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
           [ 3.,  4., -4.],
           [-3., -2., -1.]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    The inverse of `fftshift`. Although identical for even-length `x`, the
    functions differ by one sample for odd-length `x`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array.
    axes : int or shape tuple, optional
        Axes over which to calculate.  Defaults to None, which shifts all axes.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The shifted array.

    See Also
    --------
    fftshift : Shift zero-frequency component to the center of the spectrum.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(9, d=1./9).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> freqs
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
           [ 3.,  4., -4.],
           [-3., -2., -1.]])

    >>> np.fft.ifftshift(np.fft.fftshift(freqs))
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
           [ 3.,  4., -4.],
           [-3., -2., -1.]])

    Shift a 1-D array:
    
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1])
    >>> np.fft.ifftshift(x)
    array([ 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the usage of `ifftshift` on a 1-D array, as the existing examples only show its usage on a 2-D array. This additional example provides a clearer understanding of how `ifftshift` works on arrays of different dimensions.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already demonstrate the basic functionality of `ifftshift`, and the additional example provides a clear illustration of its usage on a 1-D array. Further examples may be redundant and may not add significant value to the documentation.
