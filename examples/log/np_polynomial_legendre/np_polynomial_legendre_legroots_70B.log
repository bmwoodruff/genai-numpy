I will provide you with the docstring for the legroots function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.legendre.legroots. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the roots of a Legendre series.

    Return the roots (a.k.a. "zeros") of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = \sum_i c[i] * L_i(x).

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array_like
        1-D array of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of the roots of the series. If all the roots are real,
        then `out` is also real, otherwise it is complex.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polyroots
    numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebroots
    numpy.polynomial.laguerre.lagroots
    numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermroots
    numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermeroots

    Notes
    -----
    The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion
    matrix, Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large
    errors due to the numerical instability of the series for such values.
    Roots with multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger errors as
    the value of the series near such points is relatively insensitive to
    errors in the roots. Isolated roots near the origin can be improved by
    a few iterations of Newton's method.

    The Legendre series basis polynomials aren't powers of ``x`` so the
    results of this function may seem unintuitive.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.polynomial.legendre as leg
    >>> leg.legroots((1, 2, 3, 4)) # 4L_3 + 3L_2 + 2L_1 + 1L_0, all real roots
    array([-0.85099543, -0.11407192,  0.51506735]) # may vary
