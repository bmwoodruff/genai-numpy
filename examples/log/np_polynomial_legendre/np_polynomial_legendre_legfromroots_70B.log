I will provide you with the docstring for the legfromroots function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.legendre.legfromroots. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Generate a Legendre series with given roots.

    The function returns the coefficients of the polynomial

    .. math:: p(x) = (x - r_0) * (x - r_1) * ... * (x - r_n),

    in Legendre form, where the :math:`r_n` are the roots specified in `roots`.
    If a zero has multiplicity n, then it must appear in `roots` n times.
    For instance, if 2 is a root of multiplicity three and 3 is a root of
    multiplicity 2, then `roots` looks something like [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]. The
    roots can appear in any order.

    If the returned coefficients are `c`, then

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... +  c_n * L_n(x)

    The coefficient of the last term is not generally 1 for monic
    polynomials in Legendre form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roots : array_like
        Sequence containing the roots.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        1-D array of coefficients.  If all roots are real then `out` is a
        real array, if some of the roots are complex, then `out` is complex
        even if all the coefficients in the result are real (see Examples
        below).

    numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermefromroots

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.polynomial.legendre as L
    >>> L.legfromroots((-1,0,1)) # x^3 - x relative to the standard basis
    array([ 0. , -0.4,  0. ,  0.4])
    >>> j = complex(0,1)
    >>> L.legfromroots((-j,j)) # x^2 + 1 relative to the standard basis
    array([ 1.33333333+0.j,  0.00000000+0.j,  0.66666667+0.j]) # may vary

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy.polynomial.legendre as L
    >>> L.legfromroots((-1,0,1)) # x^3 - x relative to the standard basis
    array([ 0. , -0.4,  0. ,  0.4])
    >>> j = complex(0,1)
    >>> L.legfromroots((-j,j)) # x^2 + 1 relative to the standard basis
    array([ 1.33333333+0.j,  0.00000000+0.j,  0.66666667+0.j]) # may vary
    Roots of a quadratic polynomial: 
    >>> L.legfromroots((1,2)) # 2*x^2 - 5*x + 2 relative to the standard basis
    array([ 2. , -5. ,  2.])

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only cover cubic and quadratic polynomials with complex roots. This new example shows how to generate a quadratic polynomial with real roots, which is a common use case for this function. It also helps to illustrate how the function works with simpler polynomials.

I stopped here because the existing examples and this new one cover a good range of use cases for this function, including complex roots, real roots, and polynomials of different degrees. Adding more examples might make the documentation too verbose and less readable.
