I will provide you with the docstring for the legtrim function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polynomial.legendre.legtrim. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Remove "small" "trailing" coefficients from a polynomial.

    "Small" means "small in absolute value" and is controlled by the
    parameter `tol`; "trailing" means highest order coefficient(s), e.g., in
    ``[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]`` (which represents ``0 + x + x**2 + 0*x**3 + 0*x**4``)
    both the 3-rd and 4-th order coefficients would be "trimmed."

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-d array of coefficients, ordered from lowest order to highest.
    tol : number, optional
        Trailing (i.e., highest order) elements with absolute value less
        than or equal to `tol` (default value is zero) are removed.

    Returns
    -------
    trimmed : ndarray
        1-d array with trailing zeros removed.  If the resulting series
        would be empty, a series containing a single zero is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `tol` < 0

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polyutils as pu
    >>> pu.trimcoef((0,0,3,0,5,0,0))
    array([0.,  0.,  3.,  0.,  5.])
    >>> pu.trimcoef((0,0,1e-3,0,1e-5,0,0),1e-3) # item == tol is trimmed
    array([0.])
    >>> i = complex(0,1) # works for complex
    >>> pu.trimcoef((3e-4,1e-3*(1-i),5e-4,2e-5*(1+i)), 1e-3)
    array([0.0003+0.j   , 0.001 -0.001j])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Remove "small" "trailing" coefficients from a polynomial.

    "Small" means "small in absolute value" and is controlled by the
    parameter `tol`; "trailing" means highest order coefficient(s), e.g., in
    ``[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]`` (which represents ``0 + x + x**2 + 0*x**3 + 0*x**4``)
    both the 3-rd and 4-th order coefficients would be "trimmed."

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-d array of coefficients, ordered from lowest order to highest.
    tol : number, optional
        Trailing (i.e., highest order) elements with absolute value less
        than or equal to `tol` (default value is zero) are removed.

    Returns
    -------
    trimmed : ndarray
        1-d array with trailing zeros removed.  If the resulting series
        would be empty, a series containing a single zero is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `tol` < 0

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polyutils as pu
    >>> pu.trimcoef((0,0,3,0,5,0,0))
    array([0.,  0.,  3.,  0.,  5.])
    >>> pu.trimcoef((0,0,1e-3,0,1e-5,0,0),1e-3) # item == tol is trimmed
    array([0.])
    >>> i = complex(0,1) # works for complex
    >>> pu.trimcoef((3e-4,1e-3*(1-i),5e-4,2e-5*(1+i)), 1e-3)
    array([0.0003+0.j   , 0.001 -0.001j])
    Trimming all coefficients:
    >>> np.polynomial.legendre.legtrim((0,0,0,0,0,0,0), 1)
    array([0.])

I decided to add this example because it shows the behavior of the function when all coefficients are considered "small" and should be trimmed. This can help users understand how the function handles edge cases.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a good range of scenarios, including trimming coefficients with different tolerances, working with complex coefficients, and trimming coefficients that are exactly equal to the tolerance. The additional example I added provides further insight into the function's behavior, but I believe that's sufficient for now.
