I will provide you with the docstring for the normalize_axis_tuple function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.lib.array_utils.normalize_axis_tuple. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Normalizes an axis argument into a tuple of non-negative integer axes.

    This handles shorthands such as ``1`` and converts them to ``(1,)``,
    as well as performing the handling of negative indices covered by
    `normalize_axis_index`.

    By default, this forbids axes from being specified multiple times.

    Used internally by multi-axis-checking logic.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    axis : int, iterable of int
        The un-normalized index or indices of the axis.
    ndim : int
        The number of dimensions of the array that `axis` should be normalized
        against.
    argname : str, optional
        A prefix to put before the error message, typically the name of the
        argument.
    allow_duplicate : bool, optional
        If False, the default, disallow an axis from being specified twice.

    Returns
    -------
    normalized_axes : tuple of int
        The normalized axis index, such that `0 <= normalized_axis < ndim`

    Raises
    ------
    AxisError
        If any axis provided is out of range
    ValueError
        If an axis is repeated

Here is the updated docstring with additional examples:

    Normalizes an axis argument into a tuple of non-negative integer axes.

    This handles shorthands such as ``1`` and converts them to ``(1,)``,
    as well as performing the handling of negative indices covered by
    `normalize_axis_index`.

    By default, this forbids axes from being specified multiple times.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    axis : int, iterable of int
        The un-normalized index or indices of the axis.
    ndim : int
        The number of dimensions of the array that `axis` should be normalized
        against.
    argname : str, optional

        argument.
    allow_duplicate : bool, optional
        If False, the default, disallow an axis from being specified twice.

    Returns
    -------
    normalized_axes : tuple of int
        The normalized axis index, such that `0 <= normalized_axis < ndim`

    Raises
    ------
    AxisError
        If any axis provided is out of range
    ValueError
        If an axis is repeated

    --------
    normalize_axis_index : normalizing a single scalar axis

    Examples:
    Single axis:
    >>> np.lib.array.normalize_axis_tuple(1, 3)
    (1,)

    Multiple axes:
    >>> np.lib.array.normalize_axis_tuple((0, 2), 3)
    (0, 2)

    Negative axis:
    >>> np.lib.array.normalize_axis_tuple(-1, 3)
    (2,)

    Allowing duplicate axes:
    >>> np.lib.array.normalize_axis_tuple((0, 0), 3, allow_duplicate=True)
    (0, 0)

    Duplicate axes without allow_duplicate:
    >>> np.lib.array.normalize_axis_tuple((0, 0), 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Duplicate axis


I decided to add these examples because they cover different scenarios that the function can be used in, such as single axis, multiple axes, negative axis, and allowing duplicate axes. These examples help to illustrate the behavior of the function in different situations.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples and the new ones I added cover the main use cases of the function. Adding more examples would not provide additional clarity or usefulness to the user.
