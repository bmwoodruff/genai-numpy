I will provide you with the docstring for the byte_bounds function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.lib.array_utils.byte_bounds. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Returns pointers to the end-points of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array. It must conform to the Python-side of the array
        interface.

    Returns
    -------
    (low, high) : tuple of 2 integers
        The first integer is the first byte of the array, the second
        integer is just past the last byte of the array.  If `a` is not
        contiguous it will not use every byte between the (`low`, `high`)
        values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> I = np.eye(2, dtype='f'); I.dtype
    dtype('float32')
    >>> low, high = np.lib.array_utils.byte_bounds(I)
    >>> high - low == I.size*I.itemsize
    True
    >>> I = np.eye(2); I.dtype
    dtype('float64')
    >>> low, high = np.lib.array_utils.byte_bounds(I)
    >>> high - low == I.size*I.itemsize
    True

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Returns pointers to the end-points of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array. It must conform to the Python-side of the array
        interface.

    Returns
    -------
    (low, high) : tuple of 2 integers
        The first integer is the first byte of the array, the second
        integer is just past the last byte of the array.  If `a` is not
        contiguous it will not use every byte between the (`low`, `high`)
        values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> I = np.eye(2, dtype='f'); I.dtype
    dtype('float32')
    >>> low, high = np.lib.array.array.byte_bounds(I)
    >>> high - low == I.size*I.itemsize
    True
    >>> I = np.eye(2); I.dtype
    dtype('float64')
    >>> low, high = np.lib.array.array.byte_bounds(I)
    >>> high - low == I.size*I.itemsize
    True
    Non-contiguous array:
    >>> I = np.eye(2)[::2]; I.dtype
    dtype('float64')
    >>> low, high = np.lib.array.array.byte_bounds(I)
    >>> high - low != I.size*I.itemsize
    True
