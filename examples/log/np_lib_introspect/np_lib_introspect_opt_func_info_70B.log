I will provide you with the docstring for the opt_func_info function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.lib.introspect.opt_func_info. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Returns a dictionary containing the currently supported CPU dispatched
    features for all optimized functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func_name : str (optional)
        Regular expression to filter by function name.

    signature : str (optional)
        Regular expression to filter by data type.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary where keys are optimized function names and values are
        nested dictionaries indicating supported targets based on data types.

    Examples
    --------
    Retrieve dispatch information for functions named 'add' or 'sub' and
    data types 'float64' or 'float32':

    >>> dict = np.lib.introspect.opt_func_info(
    ...     func_name="add|abs", signature="float64|complex64"
    ... )
    >>> import json
    >>> print(json.dumps(dict, indent=2))
        {
          "absolute": {
            "dd": {
              "current": "SSE41",
              "available": "SSE41 baseline(SSE SSE2 SSE3)"
            },
            "Ff": {
              "current": "FMA3__AVX2",
              "available": "AVX512F FMA3__AVX2 baseline(SSE SSE2 SSE3)"
            },
            "Dd": {
              "current": "FMA3__AVX2",
              "available": "AVX512F FMA3__AVX2 baseline(SSE SSE2 SSE3)"
            }
          },
          "add": {
            "ddd": {
              "current": "FMA3__AVX2",
              "available": "FMA3__AVX2 baseline(SSE SSE2 SSE3)"
            },
            "FFF": {
              "current": "FMA3__AVX2",
              "available": "FMA3__AVX2 baseline(SSE SSE2 SSE3)"
            }
          }

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Returns a dictionary containing the currently supported CPU dispatched
    features for all optimized functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func_name : str (optional)
        Regular expression to filter by function name.

    signature : str (optional)
        Regular expression to filter by data type.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary where keys are optimized function names and values are
        nested dictionaries indicating supported targets based on data types.

    Examples
    --------
    Retrieve dispatch information for functions named 'add' or 'sub' and
    data types 'float64' or 'float32':

    >>> dict = np.lib.introspect.opt_func_info(
    ...     func_name="add|abs", signature="float64|complex64"
    ... )
    >>> import json
    >>> print(json.dumps(dict, indent=2))
        {
          "absolute": {
            "dd": {
              "current": "SSE41",
              "available": "SSE41 baseline(SSE SSE2 SSE3)"
            },

            }
          }
        }

    Retrieve dispatch information for all optimized functions with default filters:

    >>> dict = np.lib.introspect.opt_func_info()
    >>> import json
    >>> print(json.dumps(dict, indent=2))
