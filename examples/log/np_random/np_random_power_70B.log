I will provide you with the docstring for the power function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.power. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        power(a, size=None)

        Draws samples in [0, 1] from a power distribution with positive
        exponent a - 1.

        Also known as the power function distribution.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.power`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float or array_like of floats
            Parameter of the distribution. Must be non-negative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized power distribution.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If a <= 0.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.power: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function is

        .. math:: P(x; a) = ax^{a-1}, 0 \le x \le 1, a>0.

        The power function distribution is just the inverse of the Pareto
        distribution. It may also be seen as a special case of the Beta
        distribution.

        It is used, for example, in modeling the over-reporting of insurance
        claims.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> a = 5. # shape
        >>> samples = 1000
        >>> s = np.random.power(a, samples)

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, bins=30)
        >>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
        >>> y = a*x**(a-1.)
        >>> normed_y = samples*np.diff(bins)[0]*y
        >>> plt.plot(x, normed_y)
        >>> plt.show()

        Compare the power function distribution to the inverse of the Pareto.

        >>> from scipy import stats # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> rvs = np.random.power(5, 1000000)
        >>> rvsp = np.random.pareto(5, 1000000)
        >>> xx = np.linspace(0,1,100)
        >>> powpdf = stats.powerlaw.pdf(xx,5)  # doctest: +SKIP

        >>> plt.figure()
        >>> plt.hist(rvs, bins=50, density=True)
        >>> plt.plot(xx,powpdf,'r-')  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.title('np.random.power(5)')

        >>> plt.figure()
        >>> plt.hist(1./(1.+rvsp), bins=50, density=True)
        >>> plt.plot(xx,powpdf,'r-')  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.title('inverse of 1 + np.random.pareto(5)')

        >>> plt.figure()
        >>> plt.hist(1./(1.+rvsp), bins=50, density=True)
        >>> plt.plot(xx,powpdf,'r-')  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.title('inverse of stats.pareto(5)')

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
Draw samples from the distribution:

>>> a = 5. # shape
>>> samples = 1000
>>> s = np.random.power(a, samples)

Display the histogram of the samples, along with
the probability density function:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, bins=30)
>>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
>>> y = a*x**(a-1.)
>>> normed_y = samples*np.diff(bins)[0]*y
>>> plt.plot(x, normed_y)
>>> plt.show()

Compare the power function distribution to the inverse of the Pareto.

>>> from scipy import stats # doctest: +SKIP
>>> rvs = np.random.power(5, 1000000)
>>> rvsp = np.random.pareto(5, 1000000)
>>> xx = np.linspace(0,1,100)
>>> powpdf = stats.powerlaw.pdf(xx,5)  # doctest: +SKIP

>>> plt.figure()
>>> plt.hist(rvs, bins=50, density=True)
>>> plt.plot(xx,powpdf,'r-')  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> plt.title('np.random.power(5)')

>>> plt.figure()
>>> plt.hist(1./(1.+rvsp), bins=50, density=True)
>>> plt.plot(xx,powpdf,'r-')  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> plt.title('inverse of 1 + np.random.pareto(5)')

>>> plt.figure()
>>> plt.hist(1./(1.+rvsp), bins=50, density=True)
>>> plt.plot(xx,powpdf,'r-')  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> plt.title('inverse of stats.pareto(5)')

Using np.random.power with a scalar value:

>>> a = 2.5
>>> s = np.random.power(a)
>>> print(s)

I decided to add the last example because it shows how to use `np.random.power` with a scalar value, which is a common use case. This example is useful because it demonstrates that `np.random.power` can be used to generate a single random value, not just an array of values.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a range of use cases, including generating samples, plotting the distribution, and comparing it to the inverse of the Pareto distribution. The additional example I added provides a simple and concise demonstration of using `np.random.power` with a scalar value.
