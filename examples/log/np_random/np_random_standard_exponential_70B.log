I will provide you with the docstring for the standard_exponential function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.standard_exponential. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        standard_exponential(size=None)

        Draw samples from the standard exponential distribution.

        `standard_exponential` is identical to the exponential distribution
        with a scale parameter of 1.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_exponential`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        out : float or ndarray
            Drawn samples.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.standard_exponential: which should be used for new code.

        Examples
        --------
        Output a 3x8000 array:

        >>> n = np.random.standard_exponential((3, 8000))

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

        Examples
        --------
        Output a 3x8000 array:

        >>> n = np.random.standard_exponential((3, 8000))

        Single value output:

        >>> val = np.random.standard_exponential()
        >>> print(val)

I decided to add the second example because the first example only shows how to generate an array of values, but it doesn't demonstrate how to generate a single value. The second example shows how to generate a single value, which is a common use case for this function.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example and the new example I added cover the two main use cases for this function: generating an array of values and generating a single value. Additional examples might be redundant or unnecessary, and might make the documentation more cluttered and harder to read.
