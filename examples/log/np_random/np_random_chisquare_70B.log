I will provide you with the docstring for the chisquare function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.chisquare. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        chisquare(df, size=None)

        Draw samples from a chi-square distribution.

        When `df` independent random variables, each with standard normal
        distributions (mean 0, variance 1), are squared and summed, the
        resulting distribution is chi-square (see Notes).  This distribution
        is often used in hypothesis testing.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.chisquare`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        df : float or array_like of floats
             Number of degrees of freedom, must be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``df`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(df).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized chi-square distribution.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            When `df` <= 0 or when an inappropriate `size` (e.g. ``size=-1``)
            is given.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.chisquare: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The variable obtained by summing the squares of `df` independent,
        standard normally distributed random variables:

        .. math:: Q = \sum_{i=0}^{\mathtt{df}} X^2_i

        is chi-square distributed, denoted

        .. math:: Q \sim \chi^2_k.

        The probability density function of the chi-squared distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{(1/2)^{k/2}}{\Gamma(k/2)}
                         x^{k/2 - 1} e^{-x/2},

        where :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function,

        .. math:: \Gamma(x) = \int_0^{-\infty} t^{x - 1} e^{-t} dt.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.chisquare(2,4)
        array([ 1.89920014,  9.00867716,  3.13710533,  5.62318272]) # random

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.chisquare(2,4)
        array([ 1.89920014,  9.00867716,  3.13710533,  5.62318272]) # random
        Single degree of freedom: 
        >>> np.random.chisquare(1)
        0.9746093809626354 # random


I decided to add an example to show how the function behaves when the degree of freedom is 1, which is a common use case. This example helps to illustrate the behavior of the function in a simple scenario.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples and the new one I added provide a good understanding of how the function works. The first example shows how to generate an array of chi-square distributed random variables, and the second example shows how to generate a single chi-square distributed random variable with a single degree of freedom. These examples cover the main use cases of the function, and additional examples would likely be redundant or unnecessary.
