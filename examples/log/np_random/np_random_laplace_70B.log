I will provide you with the docstring for the laplace function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.laplace. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        laplace(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from the Laplace or double exponential distribution with
        specified location (or mean) and scale (decay).

        The Laplace distribution is similar to the Gaussian/normal distribution,
        but is sharper at the peak and has fatter tails. It represents the
        difference between two independent, identically distributed exponential
        random variables.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.laplace`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float or array_like of floats, optional
            The position, :math:`\mu`, of the distribution peak. Default is 0.
        scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
            :math:`\lambda`, the exponential decay. Default is 1. Must be non-
            negative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Laplace distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.laplace: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        It has the probability density function

        .. math:: f(x; \mu, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2\lambda}
                                       \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{\lambda}\right).

        The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency
        of an error can be expressed as an exponential function of the
        absolute magnitude of the error, which leads to the Laplace
        distribution. For many problems in economics and health
        sciences, this distribution seems to model the data better
        than the standard Gaussian distribution.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution

        >>> loc, scale = 0., 1.
        >>> s = np.random.laplace(loc, scale, 1000)

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 30, density=True)
        >>> x = np.arange(-8., 8., .01)
        >>> pdf = np.exp(-abs(x-loc)/scale)/(2.*scale)
        >>> plt.plot(x, pdf)

        Plot Gaussian for comparison:

        >>> g = (1/(scale * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *
        ...      np.exp(-(x - loc)**2 / (2 * scale**2)))
        >>> plt.plot(x,g)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
Draw samples from the distribution

>>> loc, scale = 0., 1.
>>> s = np.random.laplace(loc, scale, 1000)

Display the histogram of the samples, along with
the probability density function:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 30, density=True)
>>> x = np.arange(-8., 8., .01)
>>> pdf = np.exp(-abs(x-loc)/scale)/(2.*scale)
>>> plt.plot(x, pdf)

Plot Gaussian for comparison:

>>> g = (1/(scale * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *
...      np.exp(-(x - loc)**2 / (2 * scale**2)))
>>> plt.plot(x,g)

Different scales:

>>> s1 = np.random.laplace(0, 0.5, 1000)
>>> s2 = np.random.laplace(0, 1, 1000)
>>> s3 = np.random.laplace(0, 2, 1000)

I decided to add the third example because it shows how the scale parameter affects the distribution. By drawing samples with different scales, users can see how the shape of the distribution changes. This can help users understand the role of the scale parameter in the Laplace distribution.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already demonstrate the basic usage of the function, and the additional example I added provides further insight into the behavior of the function. Adding more examples would likely be redundant or focus on specific edge cases that are not critical to understanding the function's behavior.
