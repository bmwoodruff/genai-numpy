I will provide you with the docstring for the standard_gamma function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.standard_gamma. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        standard_gamma(shape, size=None)

        Draw samples from a standard Gamma distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a Gamma distribution with specified parameters,
        shape (sometimes designated "k") and scale=1.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_gamma`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : float or array_like of floats
            Parameter, must be non-negative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``shape`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(shape).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized standard gamma distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.gamma : probability density function, distribution or
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.standard_gamma: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Gamma distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},

        where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
        and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.

        The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
        electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
        waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> shape, scale = 2., 1. # mean and width
        >>> s = np.random.standard_gamma(shape, 1000000)

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> import scipy.special as sps  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 50, density=True)
        >>> y = bins**(shape-1) * ((np.exp(-bins/scale))/  # doctest: +SKIP
        ...                       (sps.gamma(shape) * scale**shape))
        >>> plt.plot(bins, y, linewidth=2, color='r')  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> shape, scale = 2., 1. # mean and width
        >>> s = np.random.standard_gamma(shape, 1000000)

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> import scipy.special as sps  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 50, density=True)
        >>> y = bins**(shape-1) * ((np.exp(-bins/scale))/  # doctest: +SKIP
        ...                       (sps.gamma(shape) * scale**shape))
        >>> plt.plot(bins, y, linewidth=2, color='r')  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.show()

        Drawing multiple samples with different shapes:

        >>> shapes = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> samples = [np.random.standard_gamma(shape, 1000) for shape in shapes]
        >>> print([sample.mean() for sample in samples])

I decided to add an example because the existing examples only demonstrate drawing samples from a single Gamma distribution. The new example shows how to draw multiple samples with different shapes, which can be useful for users who need to work with multiple distributions.

I stopped after adding one example because the new example provides a clear illustration of how to use the `standard_gamma` function with different shapes, and it is easy to understand and replicate. Adding more examples might make the documentation too verbose and less readable.
