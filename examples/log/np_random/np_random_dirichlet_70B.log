I will provide you with the docstring for the dirichlet function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.dirichlet. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        dirichlet(alpha, size=None)

        Draw samples from the Dirichlet distribution.

        Draw `size` samples of dimension k from a Dirichlet distribution. A
        Dirichlet-distributed random variable can be seen as a multivariate
        generalization of a Beta distribution. The Dirichlet distribution
        is a conjugate prior of a multinomial distribution in Bayesian
        inference.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.dirichlet`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        alpha : sequence of floats, length k
            Parameter of the distribution (length ``k`` for sample of
            length ``k``).
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            vector of length ``k`` is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray,
            The drawn samples, of shape ``(size, k)``.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If any value in ``alpha`` is less than or equal to zero

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.dirichlet: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The Dirichlet distribution is a distribution over vectors
        :math:`x` that fulfil the conditions :math:`x_i>0` and
        :math:`\sum_{i=1}^k x_i = 1`.

        The probability density function :math:`p` of a
        Dirichlet-distributed random vector :math:`X` is
        proportional to

        .. math:: p(x) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{k}{x^{\alpha_i-1}_i},

        where :math:`\alpha` is a vector containing the positive
        concentration parameters.

        The method uses the following property for computation: let :math:`Y`
        be a random vector which has components that follow a standard gamma
        distribution, then :math:`X = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^k{Y_i}} Y`
        is Dirichlet-distributed

        Examples
        --------
        Taking an example cited in Wikipedia, this distribution can be used if
        one wanted to cut strings (each of initial length 1.0) into K pieces
        with different lengths, where each piece had, on average, a designated
        average length, but allowing some variation in the relative sizes of
        the pieces.

        >>> s = np.random.dirichlet((10, 5, 3), 20).transpose()

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> plt.barh(range(20), s[0])
        >>> plt.barh(range(20), s[1], left=s[0], color='g')
        >>> plt.barh(range(20), s[2], left=s[0]+s[1], color='r')
        >>> plt.title("Lengths of Strings")

        Single Sample from a Dirichlet Distribution:
        
        >>> sample = np.random.dirichlet((0.5, 0.5))
        >>> sample

I decided to add an example to show how to draw a single sample from a Dirichlet distribution, which is a common use case. This example is simple and easy to understand, and it provides a clear illustration of how to use the function.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates how to draw multiple samples from a Dirichlet distribution, and the new example I added shows how to draw a single sample. These two examples together provide a good understanding of how to use the `dirichlet` function.
