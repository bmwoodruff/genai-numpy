I will provide you with the docstring for the negative_binomial function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.negative_binomial. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        negative_binomial(n, p, size=None)

        Draw samples from a negative binomial distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a negative binomial distribution with specified
        parameters, `n` successes and `p` probability of success where `n`
        is > 0 and `p` is in the interval [0, 1].

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.negative_binomial`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : float or array_like of floats
            Parameter of the distribution, > 0.
        p : float or array_like of floats
            Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``n`` and ``p`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(n, p).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized negative binomial distribution,
            where each sample is equal to N, the number of failures that
            occurred before a total of n successes was reached.

        .. warning::
           This function returns the C-long dtype, which is 32bit on windows
           and otherwise 64bit on 64bit platforms (and 32bit on 32bit ones).
           Since NumPy 2.0, NumPy's default integer is 32bit on 32bit platforms
           and 64bit on 64bit platforms.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.negative_binomial: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution is

        .. math:: P(N;n,p) = \frac{\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\Gamma(n)}p^{n}(1-p)^{N},

        where :math:`n` is the number of successes, :math:`p` is the
        probability of success, :math:`N+n` is the number of trials, and
        :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function. When :math:`n` is an integer,
        :math:`\frac{\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\Gamma(n)} = \binom{N+n-1}{N}`, which is
        the more common form of this term in the pmf. The negative
        binomial distribution gives the probability of N failures given n
        successes, with a success on the last trial.

        If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a "1" appears,
        then the probability distribution of the number of non-"1"s that
        appear before the third "1" is a negative binomial distribution.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        A real world example. A company drills wild-cat oil
        exploration wells, each with an estimated probability of
        success of 0.1.  What is the probability of having one success
        for each successive well, that is what is the probability of a
        single success after drilling 5 wells, after 6 wells, etc.?

        >>> s = np.random.negative_binomial(1, 0.1, 100000)
        >>> for i in range(1, 11): # doctest: +SKIP
        ...    probability = sum(s<i) / 100000.
        ...    print(i, "wells drilled, probability of one success =", probability)

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

        Drawing multiple samples with different parameters:

        >>> n = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> p = [0.1, 0.5, 0.8]
        >>> s = np.random.negative_binomial(n, p, size=(3, 3))
        >>> s

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how to draw multiple samples with different parameters, as the existing example only shows a single sample with fixed parameters. This example shows how to use the function with arrays of parameters, which can be useful for users who need to simulate multiple scenarios.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already provides a good illustration of how to use the function, and the additional example I added covers a different use case. Adding more examples might make the documentation too verbose and less readable.
