I will provide you with the docstring for the wald function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.wald. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        wald(mean, scale, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Wald, or inverse Gaussian, distribution.

        As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
        Gaussian. Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian
        with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.

        The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
        Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian
        because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a
        unit distance and distance covered in unit time.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.wald`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : float or array_like of floats
            Distribution mean, must be > 0.
        scale : float or array_like of floats
            Scale parameter, must be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.wald: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the Wald distribution is

        .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
                                    \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}

        As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise
        from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a
        competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and
        modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw values from the distribution and plot the histogram:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> h = plt.hist(np.random.wald(3, 2, 100000), bins=200, density=True)
        >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
Draw values from the distribution and plot the histogram:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> h = plt.hist(np.random.wald(3, 2, 100000), bins=200, density=True)
>>> plt.show()

Mean and scale as arrays:

>>> mean = [1, 2, 3]
>>> scale = [4, 5, 6]
>>> np.random.wald(mean, scale)

I decided to add the second example because the original docstring only showed an example with scalar mean and scale, but the function also supports array-like inputs. This additional example demonstrates how to use the function with array-like inputs, which can be useful for users who need to draw samples from multiple distributions with different parameters.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic usage of the function, and the additional example covers a common use case with array-like inputs. Further examples may be redundant or too specific, and may not provide significant additional value to users.
