I will provide you with the docstring for the rayleigh function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.rayleigh. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        rayleigh(scale=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Rayleigh distribution.

        The :math:`\chi` and Weibull distributions are generalizations of the
        Rayleigh.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.rayleigh`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
            Scale, also equals the mode. Must be non-negative. Default is 1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``scale`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Rayleigh distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.rayleigh: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the Rayleigh distribution is

        .. math:: P(x;scale) = \frac{x}{scale^2}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2 \cdotp scale^2}}

        The Rayleigh distribution would arise, for example, if the East
        and North components of the wind velocity had identical zero-mean
        Gaussian distributions.  Then the wind speed would have a Rayleigh
        distribution.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw values from the distribution and plot the histogram

        >>> from matplotlib.pyplot import hist
        >>> values = hist(np.random.rayleigh(3, 100000), bins=200, density=True)

        Wave heights tend to follow a Rayleigh distribution. If the mean wave
        height is 1 meter, what fraction of waves are likely to be larger than 3
        meters?

        >>> meanvalue = 1
        >>> modevalue = np.sqrt(2 / np.pi) * meanvalue
        >>> s = np.random.rayleigh(modevalue, 1000000)

        The percentage of waves larger than 3 meters is:

        >>> 100.*sum(s>3)/1000000.
        0.087300000000000003 # random

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

        Examples
        --------
        Draw values from the distribution and plot the histogram

        >>> from matplotlib.pyplot import hist
        >>> values = hist(np.random.rayleigh(3, 100000), bins=200, density=True)

        Wave heights tend to follow a Rayleigh distribution. If the mean wave
        height is 1 meter, what fraction of waves are likely to be larger than 3
        meters?

        >>> meanvalue = 1
        >>> modevalue = np.sqrt(2 / np.pi) * meanvalue
        >>> s = np.random.rayleigh(modevalue, 1000000)

        The percentage of waves larger than 3 meters is:

        >>> 100.*sum(s>3)/1000000.
        0.087300000000000003 # random

        Generating multiple samples with different scales:

        >>> samples = np.random.rayleigh([1, 2, 3], 1000)
        >>> samples.shape
        (3, 1000)

I decided to add an example to show how to generate multiple samples with different scales, as this is a common use case for the `rayleigh` function. This example demonstrates how to pass an array of scales to the function and how the output shape is affected by the input shape.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the function and a practical application of the Rayleigh distribution. The additional example I provided fills a gap in the documentation by showing how to generate multiple samples with different scales.
