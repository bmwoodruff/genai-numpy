I will provide you with the docstring for the randint function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.randint. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        randint(low, high=None, size=None, dtype=int)

        Return random integers from `low` (inclusive) to `high` (exclusive).

        Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution of
        the specified dtype in the "half-open" interval [`low`, `high`). If
        `high` is None (the default), then results are from [0, `low`).

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.integers`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        low : int or array-like of ints
            Lowest (signed) integers to be drawn from the distribution (unless
            ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is one above the
            *highest* such integer).
        high : int or array-like of ints, optional
            If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn
            from the distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
            If array-like, must contain integer values
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        dtype : dtype, optional
            Desired dtype of the result. Byteorder must be native.
            The default value is long.

            .. versionadded:: 1.11.0

            .. warning::
              This function defaults to the C-long dtype, which is 32bit on windows
              and otherwise 64bit on 64bit platforms (and 32bit on 32bit ones).
              Since NumPy 2.0, NumPy's default integer is 32bit on 32bit platforms
              and 64bit on 64bit platforms.  Which corresponds to `np.intp`.
              (`dtype=int` is not the same as in most NumPy functions.)

        Returns
        -------
        out : int or ndarray of ints
            `size`-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate
            distribution, or a single such random int if `size` not provided.

        See Also
        --------
        random_integers : similar to `randint`, only for the closed
            interval [`low`, `high`], and 1 is the lowest value if `high` is
            omitted.
        random.Generator.integers: which should be used for new code.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.randint(2, size=10)
        array([1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]) # random
        >>> np.random.randint(1, size=10)
        array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

        Generate a 2 x 4 array of ints between 0 and 4, inclusive:

        >>> np.random.randint(5, size=(2, 4))
        array([[4, 0, 2, 1], # random
               [3, 2, 2, 0]])

        Generate a 1 x 3 array with 3 different upper bounds

        >>> np.random.randint(1, [3, 5, 10])
        array([2, 2, 9]) # random

        Generate a 1 by 3 array with 3 different lower bounds

        >>> np.random.randint([1, 5, 7], 10)
        array([9, 8, 7]) # random

        Generate a 2 by 4 array using broadcasting with dtype of uint8

        >>> np.random.randint([1, 3, 5, 7], [[10], [20]], dtype=np.uint8)
        array([[ 8,  6,  9,  7], # random
               [ 1, 16,  9, 12]], dtype=uint8)
