I will provide you with the docstring for the uniform function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.uniform. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from a uniform distribution.

        Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
        ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
        any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
        by `uniform`.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.uniform`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        low : float or array_like of floats, optional
            Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
            greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
        high : float or array_like of floats
            Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
            less than or equal to high.  The high limit may be included in the 
            returned array of floats due to floating-point rounding in the 
            equation ``low + (high-low) * random_sample()``.  The default value 
            is 1.0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``low`` and ``high`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(low, high).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized uniform distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        randint : Discrete uniform distribution, yielding integers.
        random_integers : Discrete uniform distribution over the closed
                          interval ``[low, high]``.
        random_sample : Floats uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
        random : Alias for `random_sample`.
        rand : Convenience function that accepts dimensions as input, e.g.,
               ``rand(2,2)`` would generate a 2-by-2 array of floats,
               uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
        random.Generator.uniform: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function of the uniform distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}

        anywhere within the interval ``[a, b)``, and zero elsewhere.

        When ``high`` == ``low``, values of ``low`` will be returned.
        If ``high`` < ``low``, the results are officially undefined
        and may eventually raise an error, i.e. do not rely on this
        function to behave when passed arguments satisfying that
        inequality condition. The ``high`` limit may be included in the
        returned array of floats due to floating-point rounding in the
        equation ``low + (high-low) * random_sample()``. For example:

        >>> x = np.float32(5*0.99999999)
        >>> x
        5.0


        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> s = np.random.uniform(-1,0,1000)

        All values are within the given interval:

        >>> np.all(s >= -1)
        True
        >>> np.all(s < 0)
        True

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with the
        probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 15, density=True)
        >>> plt.plot(bins, np.ones_like(bins), linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> s = np.random.uniform(-1,0,1000)

        All values are within the given interval:

        >>> np.all(s >= -1)
        True
        >>> np.all(s < 0)
        True

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with the
        probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 15, density=True)
        >>> plt.plot(bins, np.ones_like(bins), linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.show()

        Uniform distribution with different size:

        >>> s = np.random.uniform(-1,1,(3,2))
        >>> s.shape
        (3, 2)

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how the `size` parameter can be used to generate an array of samples with a specific shape. This example shows how to generate a 3x2 array of samples from the uniform distribution.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the `uniform` function, and the new example provides additional information about the `size` parameter.
