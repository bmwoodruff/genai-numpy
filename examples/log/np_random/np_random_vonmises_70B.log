I will provide you with the docstring for the vonmises function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.vonmises. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        vonmises(mu, kappa, size=None)

        Draw samples from a von Mises distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a von Mises distribution with specified mode
        (mu) and dispersion (kappa), on the interval [-pi, pi].

        The von Mises distribution (also known as the circular normal
        distribution) is a continuous probability distribution on the unit
        circle.  It may be thought of as the circular analogue of the normal
        distribution.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.vonmises`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mu : float or array_like of floats
            Mode ("center") of the distribution.
        kappa : float or array_like of floats
            Dispersion of the distribution, has to be >=0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``mu`` and ``kappa`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mu, kappa).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized von Mises distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.vonmises : probability density function, distribution, or
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.vonmises: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the von Mises distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{\kappa cos(x-\mu)}}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)},

        where :math:`\mu` is the mode and :math:`\kappa` the dispersion,
        and :math:`I_0(\kappa)` is the modified Bessel function of order 0.

        The von Mises is named for Richard Edler von Mises, who was born in
        Austria-Hungary, in what is now the Ukraine.  He fled to the United
        States in 1939 and became a professor at Harvard.  He worked in
        probability theory, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, and philosophy of
        science.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> mu, kappa = 0.0, 4.0 # mean and dispersion
        >>> s = np.random.vonmises(mu, kappa, 1000)

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> from scipy.special import i0  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.hist(s, 50, density=True)
        >>> x = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, num=51)
        >>> y = np.exp(kappa*np.cos(x-mu))/(2*np.pi*i0(kappa))  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.plot(x, y, linewidth=2, color='r')  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> mu, kappa = 0.0, 4.0 # mean and dispersion
        >>> s = np.random.vonmises(mu, kappa, 1000)

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> from scipy.special import i0  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.hist(s, 50, density=True)
        >>> x = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, num=51)
        >>> y = np.exp(kappa*np.cos(x-mu))/(2*np.pi*i0(kappa))  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.plot(x, y, linewidth=2, color='r')  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> plt.show()

        Drawing multiple samples with different modes and dispersions:

        >>> mu = [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]
        >>> kappa = [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
        >>> s = np.random.vonmises(mu, kappa, (3, 1000))
        >>> print(s.shape)  # Output: (3, 1000)

I decided to add an example because the existing examples only demonstrate drawing samples from a single von Mises distribution. The new example shows how to draw multiple samples from different von Mises distributions with varying modes and dispersions. This can be useful for users who need to generate samples from multiple distributions.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already provide a good understanding of how to use the `vonmises` function, and the new example adds a useful variation to the existing examples. Adding more examples might make the documentation too verbose and less readable.
