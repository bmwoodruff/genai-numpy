I will provide you with the docstring for the multivariate_normal function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.multivariate_normal. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        multivariate_normal(mean, cov, size=None, check_valid='warn', tol=1e-8)

        Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.

        The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
        generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
        dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
        covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
        (average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
        squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.multivariate_normal`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
            Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
        cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
            Covariance matrix of the distribution. It must be symmetric and
            positive-semidefinite for proper sampling.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
            generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
            each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
            If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
        check_valid : { 'warn', 'raise', 'ignore' }, optional
            Behavior when the covariance matrix is not positive semidefinite.
        tol : float, optional
            Tolerance when checking the singular values in covariance matrix.
            cov is cast to double before the check.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
            the shape is ``(N,)``.

            In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
            value drawn from the distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.multivariate_normal: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
        location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
        analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
        univariate normal distribution.

        Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
        From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
        samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
        element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
        The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
        "spread").

        Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
        approximations include:

        - Spherical covariance (`cov` is a multiple of the identity matrix)
        - Diagonal covariance (`cov` has non-negative elements, and only on
          the diagonal)

        This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
        generated data-points:

        >>> mean = [0, 0]
        >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 100]]  # diagonal covariance

        Diagonal covariance means that points are oriented along x or y-axis:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> x, y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 5000).T
        >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'x')
        >>> plt.axis('equal')
        >>> plt.show()

        Note that the covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (a.k.a.
        nonnegative-definite). Otherwise, the behavior of this method is
        undefined and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> mean = (1, 2)
        >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
        >>> x = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, (3, 3))
        >>> x.shape
        (3, 3, 2)

        Here we generate 800 samples from the bivariate normal distribution
        with mean [0, 0] and covariance matrix [[6, -3], [-3, 3.5]].  The
        expected variances of the first and second components of the sample
        are 6 and 3.5, respectively, and the expected correlation
        coefficient is -3/sqrt(6*3.5) â‰ˆ -0.65465.

        >>> cov = np.array([[6, -3], [-3, 3.5]])
        >>> pts = np.random.multivariate_normal([0, 0], cov, size=800)

        Check that the mean, covariance, and correlation coefficient of the
        sample are close to the expected values:

        >>> pts.mean(axis=0)
        array([ 0.0326911 , -0.01280782])  # may vary
        >>> np.cov(pts.T)
        array([[ 5.96202397, -2.85602287],
               [-2.85602287,  3.47613949]])  # may vary
        >>> np.corrcoef(pts.T)[0, 1]
        -0.6273591314603949  # may vary

        We can visualize this data with a scatter plot.  The orientation
        of the point cloud illustrates the negative correlation of the
        components of this sample.

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> plt.plot(pts[:, 0], pts[:, 1], '.', alpha=0.5)
        >>> plt.axis('equal')
        >>> plt.grid()
        >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

        Examples
        --------
        >>> mean = (1, 2)
        >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
        >>> x = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, (3, 3))
        >>> x.shape
        (3, 3, 2)

        >>> cov = np.array([[6, -3], [-3, 3.5]])
        >>> pts = np.random.multivariate_normal([0, 0], cov, size=800)

        >>> pts.mean(axis=0)
        array([ 0.0326911 , -0.01280782])  # may vary
        >>> np.cov(pts.T)
        array([[ 5.96202397, -2.85602287],
               [-2.85602287,  3.47613949]])  # may vary
        >>> np.corrcoef(pts.T)[0, 1]
        -0.6273591314603949  # may vary

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> plt.plot(pts[:, 0], pts[:, 1], '.', alpha=0.5)
        >>> plt.axis('equal')
        >>> plt.grid()
        >>> plt.show()

        Generating samples with spherical covariance:
        >>> mean = [0, 0, 0]
        >>> cov = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
        >>> x = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 500)
        >>> x.shape
        (500, 3)

I decided to add an example to show how to generate samples with spherical covariance, which is a common and simple case of multivariate normal distribution. This example helps to illustrate how the function can be used in a different scenario.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover various aspects of the function, such as generating samples with different covariance matrices, checking the mean, covariance, and correlation coefficient of the samples, and visualizing the data. The additional example I provided adds a new scenario, but further examples would likely be redundant or too specific.
