I will provide you with the docstring for the random_integers function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.random_integers. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        random_integers(low, high=None, size=None)

        Random integers of type `numpy.int_` between `low` and `high`, inclusive.

        Return random integers of type `numpy.int_` from the "discrete uniform"
        distribution in the closed interval [`low`, `high`].  If `high` is
        None (the default), then results are from [1, `low`]. The `numpy.int_`
        type translates to the C long integer type and its precision
        is platform dependent.

        This function has been deprecated. Use randint instead.

        .. deprecated:: 1.11.0

        Parameters
        ----------
        low : int
            Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (unless
            ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is the *highest* such
            integer).
        high : int, optional
            If provided, the largest (signed) integer to be drawn from the
            distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        out : int or ndarray of ints
            `size`-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate
            distribution, or a single such random int if `size` not provided.

        See Also
        --------
        randint : Similar to `random_integers`, only for the half-open
            interval [`low`, `high`), and 0 is the lowest value if `high` is
            omitted.

        Notes
        -----
        To sample from N evenly spaced floating-point numbers between a and b,
        use::

          a + (b - a) * (np.random.random_integers(N) - 1) / (N - 1.)

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.random_integers(5)
        4 # random
        >>> type(np.random.random_integers(5))
        <class 'numpy.int64'>
        >>> np.random.random_integers(5, size=(3,2))
        array([[5, 4], # random
               [3, 3],
               [4, 5]])

        Choose five random numbers from the set of five evenly-spaced
        numbers between 0 and 2.5, inclusive (*i.e.*, from the set
        :math:`{0, 5/8, 10/8, 15/8, 20/8}`):

        >>> 2.5 * (np.random.random_integers(5, size=(5,)) - 1) / 4.
        array([ 0.625,  1.25 ,  0.625,  0.625,  2.5  ]) # random

        Roll two six sided dice 1000 times and sum the results:

        >>> d1 = np.random.random_integers(1, 6, 1000)
        >>> d2 = np.random.random_integers(1, 6, 1000)
        >>> dsums = d1 + d2

        Display results as a histogram:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(dsums, 11, density=True)
        >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

        random_integers(low, high=None, size=None)

        distribution in the closed interval [`low`, `high`].  If `high` is
        None (the default), then results are from [1, `low`]. The `numpy.int_`
