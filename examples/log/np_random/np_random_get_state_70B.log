You are a helpful assistant working to improve the NumPy documentation. Use numpydoc style guidelines.

I will provide you with the docstring for the get_state function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.get_state. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        get_state(legacy=True)

        Return a tuple representing the internal state of the generator.

        For more details, see `set_state`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        legacy : bool, optional
            Flag indicating to return a legacy tuple state when the BitGenerator
            is MT19937, instead of a dict. Raises ValueError if the underlying
            bit generator is not an instance of MT19937.

        Returns
        -------
        out : {tuple(str, ndarray of 624 uints, int, int, float), dict}
            If legacy is True, the returned tuple has the following items:

            1. the string 'MT19937'.
            2. a 1-D array of 624 unsigned integer keys.
            3. an integer ``pos``.
            4. an integer ``has_gauss``.
            5. a float ``cached_gaussian``.

            If `legacy` is False, or the BitGenerator is not MT19937, then
            state is returned as a dictionary.

        See Also
        --------
        set_state

        Notes
        -----
        `set_state` and `get_state` are not needed to work with any of the
        random distributions in NumPy. If the internal state is manually altered,
        the user should know exactly what he/she is doing.

Here is the updated docstring with additional examples:

        get_state(legacy=True)

        Return a tuple representing the internal state of the generator.

        For more details, see `set_state`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        legacy : bool, optional
            Flag indicating to return a legacy tuple state when the BitGenerator
            is MT19937, instead of a dict. Raises ValueError if the underlying
            bit generator is not an instance of MT19937.

        Returns
        -------
        out : {tuple(str, ndarray of 624 uints, int, int, float), dict}
            If legacy is True, the returned tuple has the following items:

            1. the string 'MT19937'.
            2. a 1-D array of 624 unsigned integer keys.
            3. an integer ``pos``.
            4. an integer ``has_gauss``.
            5. a float ``cached_gaussian``.

            If `legacy` is False, or the BitGenerator is not MT19937, then
            state is returned as a dictionary.

        Getting the current state of the random number generator:
        
        >>> state = np.random.get_state()
        >>> print(state)
        (..., ..., ..., ..., ...)

        Getting the current state of the random number generator in legacy format:
        
        >>> state_legacy = np.random.get_state(legacy=True)
        >>> print(state_legacy)
        ('MT19937', ..., ..., ..., ...)
