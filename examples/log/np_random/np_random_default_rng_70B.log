I will provide you with the docstring for the default_rng function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.default_rng. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

default_rng(seed=None)
Construct a new Generator with the default BitGenerator (PCG64).

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : {None, int, array_like[ints], SeedSequence, BitGenerator, Generator}, optional
        A seed to initialize the `BitGenerator`. If None, then fresh,
        unpredictable entropy will be pulled from the OS. If an ``int`` or
        ``array_like[ints]`` is passed, then all values must be non-negative and will be
        passed to `SeedSequence` to derive the initial `BitGenerator` state. One may also
        pass in a `SeedSequence` instance.
        Additionally, when passed a `BitGenerator`, it will be wrapped by
        `Generator`. If passed a `Generator`, it will be returned unaltered.

    Returns
    -------
    Generator
        The initialized generator object.

    Notes
    -----
    If ``seed`` is not a `BitGenerator` or a `Generator`, a new `BitGenerator`
    is instantiated. This function does not manage a default global instance.

    See :ref:`seeding_and_entropy` for more information about seeding.
    
    Examples
    --------
    `default_rng` is the recommended constructor for the random number class
    `Generator`. Here are several ways we can construct a random 
    number generator using `default_rng` and the `Generator` class. 
    
    Here we use `default_rng` to generate a random float:
 
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(12345)
    >>> print(rng)
    Generator(PCG64)
    >>> rfloat = rng.random()
    >>> rfloat
    0.22733602246716966
    >>> type(rfloat)
    <class 'float'>
     
    Here we use `default_rng` to generate 3 random integers between 0 
    (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive):
        
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(12345)
    >>> rints = rng.integers(low=0, high=10, size=3)
    >>> rints
    array([6, 2, 7])
    >>> type(rints[0])
    <class 'numpy.int64'>
    
    Here we specify a seed so that we have reproducible results:
    
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=42)
    >>> print(rng)
    Generator(PCG64)
    >>> arr1 = rng.random((3, 3))
    >>> arr1
    array([[0.77395605, 0.43887844, 0.85859792],
           [0.69736803, 0.09417735, 0.97562235],
           [0.7611397 , 0.78606431, 0.12811363]])

    If we exit and restart our Python interpreter, we'll see that we
    generate the same random numbers again:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=42)
    >>> arr2 = rng.random((3, 3))
    >>> arr2
    array([[0.77395605, 0.43887844, 0.85859792],
           [0.69736803, 0.09417735, 0.97562235],
           [0.7611397 , 0.78606431, 0.12811363]])
