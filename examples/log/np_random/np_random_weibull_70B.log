I will provide you with the docstring for the weibull function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.weibull. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        weibull(a, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Weibull distribution.

        Draw samples from a 1-parameter Weibull distribution with the given
        shape parameter `a`.

        .. math:: X = (-ln(U))^{1/a}

        Here, U is drawn from the uniform distribution over (0,1].

        The more common 2-parameter Weibull, including a scale parameter
        :math:`\lambda` is just :math:`X = \lambda(-ln(U))^{1/a}`.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.weibull`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float or array_like of floats
            Shape parameter of the distribution.  Must be nonnegative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Weibull distribution.

        random.Generator.weibull: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The Weibull (or Type III asymptotic extreme value distribution
        for smallest values, SEV Type III, or Rosin-Rammler
        distribution) is one of a class of Generalized Extreme Value
        (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
        This class includes the Gumbel and Frechet distributions.

        The probability density for the Weibull distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{a}
                         {\lambda}(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{a-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^a},

        where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\lambda` the scale.

        The function has its peak (the mode) at
        :math:`\lambda(\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.

        When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
        distribution.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> a = 5. # shape
        >>> s = np.random.weibull(a, 1000)

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> x = np.arange(1,100.)/50.
        >>> def weib(x,n,a):
        ...     return (a / n) * (x / n)**(a - 1) * np.exp(-(x / n)**a)

        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(np.random.weibull(5.,1000))
        >>> x = np.arange(1,100.)/50.
        >>> scale = count.max()/weib(x, 1., 5.).max()
        >>> plt.plot(x, weib(x, 1., 5.)*scale)
        >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
Draw samples from the distribution:

>>> a = 5. # shape
>>> s = np.random.weibull(a, 1000)

Display the histogram of the samples, along with
the probability density function:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> x = np.arange(1,100.)/50.
>>> def weib(x,n,a):
...     return (a / n) * (x / n)**(a - 1) * np.exp(-(x / n)**a)

>>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(np.random.weibull(5.,1000))
>>> x = np.arange(1,100.)/50.
>>> scale = count.max()/weib(x, 1., 5.).max()
>>> plt.plot(x, weib(x, 1., 5.)*scale)
>>> plt.show()

Different shape parameters produce different distributions:

>>> a = 1.5
>>> s = np.random.weibull(a, 1000)

I decided to add the second example because it shows how changing the shape parameter `a` affects the distribution of the samples. This can help users understand how to use the `weibull` function to generate different types of Weibull distributions.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already demonstrate how to use the `weibull` function to generate samples and visualize the distribution. The additional example I provided shows how to vary the shape parameter, which is an important aspect of the Weibull distribution. Further examples would likely be redundant or focus on specific use cases that may not be relevant to all users.
