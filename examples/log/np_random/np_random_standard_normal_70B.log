I will provide you with the docstring for the standard_normal function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.standard_normal. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        standard_normal(size=None)

        Draw samples from a standard Normal distribution (mean=0, stdev=1).

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_normal`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        out : float or ndarray
            A floating-point array of shape ``size`` of drawn samples, or a
            single sample if ``size`` was not specified.

        See Also
        --------
        normal :
            Equivalent function with additional ``loc`` and ``scale`` arguments
            for setting the mean and standard deviation.
        random.Generator.standard_normal: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        For random samples from the normal distribution with mean ``mu`` and
        standard deviation ``sigma``, use one of::

            mu + sigma * np.random.standard_normal(size=...)
            np.random.normal(mu, sigma, size=...)

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.standard_normal()
        2.1923875335537315 #random

        >>> s = np.random.standard_normal(8000)
        >>> s
        array([ 0.6888893 ,  0.78096262, -0.89086505, ...,  0.49876311,  # random
               -0.38672696, -0.4685006 ])                                # random
        >>> s.shape
        (8000,)
        >>> s = np.random.standard_normal(size=(3, 4, 2))
        >>> s.shape
        (3, 4, 2)

        Two-by-four array of samples from the normal distribution with
        mean 3 and standard deviation 2.5:

        >>> 3 + 2.5 * np.random.standard_normal(size=(2, 4))
        array([[-4.49401501,  4.00950034, -1.81814867,  7.29718677],   # random
               [ 0.39924804,  4.68456316,  4.99394529,  4.84057254]])  # random

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

        Generating a single standard normal variable and checking its value:
        
        >>> x = np.random.standard_normal()
        >>> -1 < x < 1
        True #random
