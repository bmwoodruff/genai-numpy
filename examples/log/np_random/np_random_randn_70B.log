You are a helpful assistant working to improve the NumPy documentation. Use numpydoc style guidelines.

I will provide you with the docstring for the randn function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.randn. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        randn(d0, d1, ..., dn)

        Return a sample (or samples) from the "standard normal" distribution.

        .. note::
            This is a convenience function for users porting code from Matlab,
            and wraps `standard_normal`. That function takes a
            tuple to specify the size of the output, which is consistent with
            other NumPy functions like `numpy.zeros` and `numpy.ones`.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_normal`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        If positive int_like arguments are provided, `randn` generates an array
        of shape ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``, filled
        with random floats sampled from a univariate "normal" (Gaussian)
        distribution of mean 0 and variance 1. A single float randomly sampled
        from the distribution is returned if no argument is provided.

        Parameters
        ----------
        d0, d1, ..., dn : int, optional
            The dimensions of the returned array, must be non-negative.
            If no argument is given a single Python float is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        Z : ndarray or float
            A ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``-shaped array of floating-point samples from
            the standard normal distribution, or a single such float if
            no parameters were supplied.

        See Also
        --------
        standard_normal : Similar, but takes a tuple as its argument.
        normal : Also accepts mu and sigma arguments.
        random.Generator.standard_normal: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        For random samples from the normal distribution with mean ``mu`` and
        standard deviation ``sigma``, use::

            sigma * np.random.randn(...) + mu

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.randn()
        2.1923875335537315  # random

        Two-by-four array of samples from the normal distribution with
        mean 3 and standard deviation 2.5:

        >>> 3 + 2.5 * np.random.randn(2, 4)
        array([[-4.49401501,  4.00950034, -1.81814867,  7.29718677],   # random
               [ 0.39924804,  4.68456316,  4.99394529,  4.84057254]])  # random

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.randn()
        2.1923875335537315  # random

        Two-by-four array of samples from the normal distribution with
        mean 3 and standard deviation 2.5:

        >>> 3 + 2.5 * np.random.randn(2, 4)
        array([[-4.49401501,  4.00950034, -1.81814867,  7.29718677],   # random
               [ 0.39924804,  4.68456316,  4.99394529,  4.84057254]])  # random

        Single precision float array:

        >>> np.random.randn(3, 3).astype(np.float32)
        array([[-0.5488135 ,  0.71518937, -0.09026056],  # random
               [ 0.60276335,  0.85796798,  0.39085621],  # random
               [ 0.38869841,  0.97873798,  0.23409574]], dtype=float32)  # random
