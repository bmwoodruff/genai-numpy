I will provide you with the docstring for the logseries function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.logseries. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        logseries(p, size=None)

        Draw samples from a logarithmic series distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a log series distribution with specified
        shape parameter, 0 <= ``p`` < 1.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.logseries`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        p : float or array_like of floats
            Shape parameter for the distribution.  Must be in the range [0, 1).
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``p`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(p).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized logarithmic series distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.logser : probability density function, distribution or
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.logseries: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Log Series distribution is

        .. math:: P(k) = \frac{-p^k}{k \ln(1-p)},

        where p = probability.

        The log series distribution is frequently used to represent species
        richness and occurrence, first proposed by Fisher, Corbet, and
        Williams in 1943 [2].  It may also be used to model the numbers of
        occupants seen in cars [3].

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> a = .6
        >>> s = np.random.logseries(a, 10000)
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s)

        #   plot against distribution

        >>> def logseries(k, p):
        ...     return -p**k/(k*np.log(1-p))
        >>> plt.plot(bins, logseries(bins, a)*count.max()/
        ...          logseries(bins, a).max(), 'r')
        >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> a = .6
        >>> s = np.random.logseries(a, 10000)
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s)

        #   plot against distribution

        >>> def logseries(k, p):
        ...     return -p**k/(k*np.log(1-p))
        >>> plt.plot(bins, logseries(bins, a)*count.max()/
        ...          logseries(bins, a).max(), 'r')
        >>> plt.show()

        Drawing multiple samples with different shape parameters:

        >>> ps = [.3, .5, .7]
        >>> samples = [np.random.logseries(p, 1000) for p in ps]
        >>> print([sample.mean() for sample in samples])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how to draw multiple samples with different shape parameters, which is a common use case for this function. This example shows how to generate multiple samples with different `p` values and calculate the mean of each sample.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already demonstrate the basic usage of the function, and the additional example provides a more advanced use case. The existing examples show how to draw samples from the distribution and plot them against the theoretical distribution, which covers the main functionality of the function. The additional example provides a more practical use case, demonstrating how to generate multiple samples with different shape parameters.
