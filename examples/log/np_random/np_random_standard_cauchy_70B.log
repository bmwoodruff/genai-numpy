I will provide you with the docstring for the standard_cauchy function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.standard_cauchy. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        standard_cauchy(size=None)

        Draw samples from a standard Cauchy distribution with mode = 0.

        Also known as the Lorentz distribution.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_cauchy`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            The drawn samples.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.standard_cauchy: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the full Cauchy distribution is

        .. math:: P(x; x_0, \gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma \bigl[ 1+
                  (\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma})^2 \bigr] }

        and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
        :math:`\gamma=1`

        The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
        oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
        also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
        a random angle will cut the x axis.

        When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
        tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
        their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
        very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples and plot the distribution:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> s = np.random.standard_cauchy(1000000)
        >>> s = s[(s>-25) & (s<25)]  # truncate distribution so it plots well
        >>> plt.hist(s, bins=100)
        >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples and plot the distribution:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> s = np.random.standard_cauchy(1000000)
        >>> s = s[(s>-25) & (s<25)]  # truncate distribution so it plots well
        >>> plt.hist(s, bins=100)
        >>> plt.show()

        Generating a 2-D array of standard Cauchy random variables:

        >>> s = np.random.standard_cauchy((3, 4))
        >>> s

I decided to add an example to show how to generate a multi-dimensional array of standard Cauchy random variables, as the existing example only demonstrates generating a 1-D array. This additional example provides a more comprehensive understanding of the function's capabilities.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic usage of the function, and the additional example covers a common use case. Further examples may be redundant or unnecessary, and the documentation should strive to be concise and focused on the most important information.
