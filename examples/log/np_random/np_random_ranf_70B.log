I will provide you with the docstring for the ranf function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.ranf. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    This is an alias of `random_sample`. See `random_sample`  for the complete
    documentation.

    Generating random floats:
    
    >>> np.random.ranf()
    0.5488135039273248

    Generating a 2x2 array of random floats:
    
    >>> np.random.ranf((2, 2))
    array([[ 0.43599474,  0.02501723],
           [ 0.36788945,  0.43360617]])


I decided to add these examples because they demonstrate the basic usage of the `ranf` function, which is to generate random floats. The first example shows how to generate a single random float, while the second example shows how to generate a 2x2 array of random floats.

I stopped after adding two examples because they cover the main use cases of the `ranf` function. The first example shows the simplest usage, and the second example shows how to generate an array of random floats. Additional examples may be redundant and may not provide more insight into the function's behavior.
