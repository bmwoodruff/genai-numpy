I will provide you with the docstring for the sample function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.sample. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    This is an alias of `random_sample`. See `random_sample`  for the complete
    documentation.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    This is an alias of `random_sample`. See `random_sample`  for the complete
    documentation.

    Generating random samples:
    
    >>> np.random.seed(0)
    >>> np.random.sample()
    0.5488135039273248

Let me explain why I decided to add this example. I added this example because the original docstring lacked any concrete illustration of how the `sample` function works. By providing a simple example that generates a random sample, users can quickly understand the basic usage of the function.

I stopped after adding just one example because the original docstring explicitly states that `sample` is an alias of `random_sample`, and users are referred to the `random_sample` documentation for complete information. This implies that the `random_sample` documentation already provides sufficient examples and explanations, making it unnecessary to add more examples to the `sample` docstring.
