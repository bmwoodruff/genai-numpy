I will provide you with the docstring for the lognormal function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.lognormal. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        lognormal(mean=0.0, sigma=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from a log-normal distribution.

        Draw samples from a log-normal distribution with specified mean,
        standard deviation, and array shape.  Note that the mean and standard
        deviation are not the values for the distribution itself, but of the
        underlying normal distribution it is derived from.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.lognormal`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : float or array_like of floats, optional
            Mean value of the underlying normal distribution. Default is 0.
        sigma : float or array_like of floats, optional
            Standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution. Must be
            non-negative. Default is 1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``sigma`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, sigma).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized log-normal distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.lognorm : probability density function, distribution,
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.lognormal: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally
        distributed.  The probability density function for the log-normal
        distribution is:

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma x \sqrt{2\pi}}
                         e^{(-\frac{(ln(x)-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}

        where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` is the standard
        deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
        A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
        of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
        the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the
        *sum* of a large number of independent, identically-distributed
        variables.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> mu, sigma = 3., 1. # mean and standard deviation
        >>> s = np.random.lognormal(mu, sigma, 1000)

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 100, density=True, align='mid')

        >>> x = np.linspace(min(bins), max(bins), 10000)
        >>> pdf = (np.exp(-(np.log(x) - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))
        ...        / (x * sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)))

        >>> plt.plot(x, pdf, linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.axis('tight')
        >>> plt.show()

        Demonstrate that taking the products of random samples from a uniform
        distribution can be fit well by a log-normal probability density
        function.

        >>> # Generate a thousand samples: each is the product of 100 random
        >>> # values, drawn from a normal distribution.
        >>> b = []
        >>> for i in range(1000):
        ...    a = 10. + np.random.standard_normal(100)
        ...    b.append(np.prod(a))

        >>> b = np.array(b) / np.min(b) # scale values to be positive
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(b, 100, density=True, align='mid')
        >>> sigma = np.std(np.log(b))
        >>> mu = np.mean(np.log(b))

        >>> x = np.linspace(min(bins), max(bins), 10000)
        >>> pdf = (np.exp(-(np.log(x) - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))
        ...        / (x * sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)))

        >>> plt.plot(x, pdf, color='r', linewidth=2)
        >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> mu, sigma = 3., 1. # mean and standard deviation

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        >>> x = np.linspace(min(bins), max(bins), 10000)
        >>> pdf = (np.exp(-(np.log(x) - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))
        ...        / (x * sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)))

        >>> plt.plot(x, pdf, linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.axis('tight')
        >>> plt.show()

        Demonstrate that taking the products of random samples from a uniform
        distribution can be fit well by a log-normal probability density
        function.

        >>> # Generate a thousand samples: each is the product of 100 random
        >>> # values, drawn from a normal distribution.
        >>> b = []
        >>> for i in range(1000):
        ...    a = 10. + np.random.standard_normal(100)
        ...    b.append(np.prod(a))

        >>> b = np.array(b) / np.min(b) # scale values to be positive
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(b, 100, density=True, align='mid')
        >>> sigma = np.std(np.log(b))
        >>> mu = np.mean(np.log(b))

        >>> x = np.linspace(min(bins), max(bins), 10000)
        >>> pdf = (np.exp(-(np.log(x) - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))
        ...        / (x * sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)))

        >>> plt.plot(x, pdf, color='r', linewidth=2)
        >>> plt.show()

        Drawing multiple samples with different means and standard deviations:

        >>> s1 = np.random.lognormal(1, 2, 1000)
        >>> s2 = np.random.lognormal(2, 1, 1000)
        >>> s3 = np.random.lognormal(3, 3, 1000)

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how to draw multiple samples with different means and standard deviations. This example shows how to use the `lognormal` function to generate multiple samples with different parameters, which can be useful for users who want to compare the distributions of different samples.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already demonstrate the basic usage of the `lognormal` function, and the new example I added provides additional information on how to use the function in a more complex scenario.
