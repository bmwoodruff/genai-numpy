I will provide you with the docstring for the logistic function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.logistic. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        logistic(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from a logistic distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a logistic distribution with specified
        parameters, loc (location or mean, also median), and scale (>0).

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.logistic`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float or array_like of floats, optional
            Parameter of the distribution. Default is 0.
        scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
            Parameter of the distribution. Must be non-negative.
            Default is 1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized logistic distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.logistic : probability density function, distribution or
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.logistic: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Logistic distribution is

        .. math:: P(x) = P(x) = \frac{e^{-(x-\mu)/s}}{s(1+e^{-(x-\mu)/s})^2},

        where :math:`\mu` = location and :math:`s` = scale.

        The Logistic distribution is used in Extreme Value problems where it
        can act as a mixture of Gumbel distributions, in Epidemiology, and by
        the World Chess Federation (FIDE) where it is used in the Elo ranking
        system, assuming the performance of each player is a logistically
        distributed random variable.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> loc, scale = 10, 1
        >>> s = np.random.logistic(loc, scale, 10000)
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, bins=50)

        #   plot against distribution

        >>> def logist(x, loc, scale):
        ...     return np.exp((loc-x)/scale)/(scale*(1+np.exp((loc-x)/scale))**2)
        >>> lgst_val = logist(bins, loc, scale)
        >>> plt.plot(bins, lgst_val * count.max() / lgst_val.max())
        >>> plt.show()
