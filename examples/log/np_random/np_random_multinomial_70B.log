I will provide you with the docstring for the multinomial function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.multinomial. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        multinomial(n, pvals, size=None)

        Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.

        The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalization of the
        binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``
        possible outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
        where the outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the
        distribution represents `n` such experiments.  Its values,
        ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the
        outcome was ``i``.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.multinomial`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        .. warning::
          This function defaults to the C-long dtype, which is 32bit on windows
          and otherwise 64bit on 64bit platforms (and 32bit on 32bit ones).
          Since NumPy 2.0, NumPy's default integer is 32bit on 32bit platforms
          and 64bit on 64bit platforms.


        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Number of experiments.
        pvals : sequence of floats, length p
            Probabilities of each of the ``p`` different outcomes.  These
            must sum to 1 (however, the last element is always assumed to
            account for the remaining probability, as long as
            ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
            the shape is ``(N,)``.

            In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
            value drawn from the distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.multinomial: which should be used for new code.

        Examples
        --------
        Throw a dice 20 times:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
        array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]]) # random

        It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.

        Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)
        array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3], # random
               [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])

        For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,
        we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.

        A loaded die is more likely to land on number 6:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5 + [2/7.])
        array([11, 16, 14, 17, 16, 26]) # random

        The probability inputs should be normalized. As an implementation
        detail, the value of the last entry is ignored and assumed to take
        up any leftover probability mass, but this should not be relied on.
        A biased coin which has twice as much weight on one side as on the
        other should be sampled like so:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3])  # RIGHT
        array([38, 62]) # random

        not like:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0, 2.0])  # WRONG
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ValueError: pvals < 0, pvals > 1 or pvals contains NaNs

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

        Examples
        --------
        Throw a dice 20 times:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
        array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]]) # random

        It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.

        Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)
        array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3], # random
               [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])

        For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,
        we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.

        A loaded die is more likely to land on number 6:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5 + [2/7.])
        array([11, 16, 14, 17, 16, 26]) # random

        The probability inputs should be normalized. As an implementation
        detail, the value of the last entry is ignored and assumed to take
        up any leftover probability mass, but this should not be relied on.
        A biased coin which has twice as much weight on one side as on the
        other should be sampled like so:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3])  # RIGHT
        array([38, 62]) # random

        not like:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0, 2.0])  # WRONG
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ValueError: pvals < 0, pvals > 1 or pvals contains NaNs

        Drawing multiple samples with different probabilities:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(10, [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], size=3)
        array([[1, 2, 3, 4], # random
               [2, 1, 4, 3],
               [3, 3, 2, 2]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate drawing multiple samples with different probabilities. This example shows how to use the `multinomial` function to draw multiple samples, each with a different set of probabilities. This can be useful in scenarios where the probabilities of the outcomes vary between experiments.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including throwing a dice, a loaded die, and a biased coin. The additional example I added provides further illustration of the function's usage, but it is not necessary to add more examples to fully understand the function's behavior.
