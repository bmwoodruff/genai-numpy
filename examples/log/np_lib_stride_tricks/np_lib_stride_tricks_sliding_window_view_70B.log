I will provide you with the docstring for the sliding_window_view function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.lib.stride_tricks.sliding_window_view. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Create a sliding window view into the array with the given window shape.

    Also known as rolling or moving window, the window slides across all
    dimensions of the array and extracts subsets of the array at all window
    positions.

    .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array to create the sliding window view from.
    window_shape : int or tuple of int
        Size of window over each axis that takes part in the sliding window.
        If `axis` is not present, must have same length as the number of input
        array dimensions. Single integers `i` are treated as if they were the
        tuple `(i,)`.
    axis : int or tuple of int, optional
        Axis or axes along which the sliding window is applied.
        By default, the sliding window is applied to all axes and
        `window_shape[i]` will refer to axis `i` of `x`.
        If `axis` is given as a `tuple of int`, `window_shape[i]` will refer to
        the axis `axis[i]` of `x`.
        Single integers `i` are treated as if they were the tuple `(i,)`.
    subok : bool, optional
        If True, sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise the returned
        array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).
    writeable : bool, optional
        When true, allow writing to the returned view. The default is false,
        as this should be used with caution: the returned view contains the
        same memory location multiple times, so writing to one location will
        cause others to change.

    Returns
    -------
    view : ndarray
        Sliding window view of the array. The sliding window dimensions are
        inserted at the end, and the original dimensions are trimmed as
        required by the size of the sliding window.
        That is, ``view.shape = x_shape_trimmed + window_shape``, where
        ``x_shape_trimmed`` is ``x.shape`` with every entry reduced by one less
        than the corresponding window size.

    See Also
    --------
    lib.stride_tricks.as_strided: A lower-level and less safe routine for
        creating arbitrary views from custom shape and strides.
    broadcast_to: broadcast an array to a given shape.

    Notes
    -----
    For many applications using a sliding window view can be convenient, but
    potentially very slow. Often specialized solutions exist, for example:

    - `scipy.signal.fftconvolve`

    - filtering functions in `scipy.ndimage`

    - moving window functions provided by
      `bottleneck <https://github.com/pydata/bottleneck>`_.

    As a rough estimate, a sliding window approach with an input size of `N`
    and a window size of `W` will scale as `O(N*W)` where frequently a special
    algorithm can achieve `O(N)`. That means that the sliding window variant
    for a window size of 100 can be a 100 times slower than a more specialized
    version.

    Nevertheless, for small window sizes, when no custom algorithm exists, or
    as a prototyping and developing tool, this function can be a good solution.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.lib.stride_tricks import sliding_window_view
    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> x.shape
    (6,)
    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3)
    >>> v.shape
    (4, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [3, 4, 5]])

    This also works in more dimensions, e.g.

    >>> i, j = np.ogrid[:3, :4]
    >>> x = 10*i + j
    >>> x.shape
    (3, 4)
    >>> x
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [10, 11, 12, 13],
           [20, 21, 22, 23]])
    >>> shape = (2,2)
    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, shape)
    >>> v.shape
    (2, 3, 2, 2)
    >>> v
    array([[[[ 0,  1],
             [10, 11]],
            [[ 1,  2],
             [11, 12]],
            [[ 2,  3],
             [12, 13]]],
           [[[10, 11],
             [20, 21]],
            [[11, 12],
             [21, 22]],
            [[12, 13],
             [22, 23]]]])

    The axis can be specified explicitly:

    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3, 0)
    >>> v.shape
    (1, 4, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[[ 0, 10, 20],
            [ 1, 11, 21],
            [ 2, 12, 22],
            [ 3, 13, 23]]])

    The same axis can be used several times. In that case, every use reduces
    the corresponding original dimension:

    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, (2, 3), (1, 1))
    >>> v.shape
    (3, 1, 2, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[[[ 0,  1,  2],
             [ 1,  2,  3]]],
           [[[10, 11, 12],
             [11, 12, 13]]],
           [[[20, 21, 22],
             [21, 22, 23]]]])

    Combining with stepped slicing (`::step`), this can be used to take sliding
    views which skip elements:

    >>> x = np.arange(7)
    >>> sliding_window_view(x, 5)[:, ::2]
    array([[0, 2, 4],
           [1, 3, 5],
           [2, 4, 6]])

    or views which move by multiple elements

    >>> x = np.arange(7)
    >>> sliding_window_view(x, 3)[::2, :]
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [4, 5, 6]])

    A common application of `sliding_window_view` is the calculation of running
    statistics. The simplest example is the
    `moving average <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average>`_:

    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> x.shape
    (6,)
    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3)
    >>> v.shape
    (4, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> moving_average = v.mean(axis=-1)
    >>> moving_average
    array([1., 2., 3., 4.])

    Note that a sliding window approach is often **not** optimal (see Notes).

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.lib.stride_tricks import sliding_window_view
    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> x.shape
    (6,)
    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3)
    >>> v.shape
    (4, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [3, 4, 5]])

    This also works in more dimensions, e.g.

    >>> i, j = np.ogrid[:3, :4]
    >>> x = 10*i + j
    >>> x.shape
    (3, 4)
    >>> x
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [10, 11, 12, 13],
           [20, 21, 22, 23]])
    >>> shape = (2,2)
    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, shape)
    >>> v.shape
    (2, 3, 2, 2)
    >>> v
    array([[[[ 0,  1],
             [10, 11]],
            [[ 1,  2],
             [11, 12]],
            [[ 2,  3],
             [12, 13]]],
           [[[10, 11],
             [20, 21]],
            [[11, 12],
             [21, 22]],
            [[12, 13],
             [22, 23]]]])

    The axis can be specified explicitly:

    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3, 0)
    >>> v.shape
    (1, 4, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[[ 0, 10, 20],
            [ 1, 11, 21],
            [ 2, 12, 22],
            [ 3, 13, 23]]])

    The same axis can be used several times. In that case, every use reduces
    the corresponding original dimension:

    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, (2, 3), (1, 1))
    >>> v.shape
    (3, 1, 2, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[[[ 0,  1,  2],
             [ 1,  2,  3]]],
           [[[10, 11, 12],
             [11, 12, 13]]],
           [[[20, 21, 22],
             [21, 22, 23]]]])

    Combining with stepped slicing (`::step`), this can be used to take sliding
    views which skip elements:

    >>> x = np.arange(7)
    >>> sliding_window_view(x, 5)[:, ::2]
    array([[0, 2, 4],
           [1, 3, 5],
           [2, 4, 6]])

    or views which move by multiple elements

    >>> x = np.arange(7)
    >>> sliding_window_view(x, 3)[::2, :]
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [4, 5, 6]])

    A common application of `sliding_window_view` is the calculation of running
    statistics. The simplest example is the
    `moving average <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average>`_:

    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> x.shape
    (6,)
    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3)
    >>> v.shape
    (4, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> moving_average = v.mean(axis=-1)
    >>> moving_average
    array([1., 2., 3., 4.])

    Using subok and writeable:
    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3, subok=True, writeable=True)
    >>> v.shape
    (4, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [3, 4, 5]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `subok` and `writeable` parameters, as they were not shown in the original examples. This example shows how to use these parameters to create a sliding window view with sub-classing and writeability.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a wide range of use cases, including 1D and 2D arrays, specifying axes, using stepped slicing, and calculating running statistics. The additional example I added provides further insight into the function's behavior with respect to sub-classing and writeability.
