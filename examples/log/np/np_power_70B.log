I will provide you with the docstring for the power function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.power. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

power(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

First array elements raised to powers from second array, element-wise.

Raise each base in `x1` to the positionally-corresponding power in
`x2`.  `x1` and `x2` must be broadcastable to the same shape.

An integer type raised to a negative integer power will raise a
``ValueError``.

Negative values raised to a non-integral value will return ``nan``.
To get complex results, cast the input to complex, or specify the
``dtype`` to be ``complex`` (see the example below).

Parameters
----------
x1 : array_like
    The bases.
x2 : array_like
    The exponents.
    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray
    The bases in `x1` raised to the exponents in `x2`.
    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

See Also
--------
float_power : power function that promotes integers to float

Examples
--------
Cube each element in an array.

>>> x1 = np.arange(6)
>>> x1
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> np.power(x1, 3)
array([  0,   1,   8,  27,  64, 125])

Raise the bases to different exponents.

>>> x2 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]
>>> np.power(x1, x2)
array([  0.,   1.,   8.,  27.,  16.,   5.])

The effect of broadcasting.

>>> x2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]])
>>> x2
array([[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1],
       [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]])
>>> np.power(x1, x2)
array([[ 0,  1,  8, 27, 16,  5],
       [ 0,  1,  8, 27, 16,  5]])

The ``**`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.power`` on
ndarrays.

>>> x2 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1])
>>> x1 = np.arange(6)
>>> x1 ** x2
array([ 0,  1,  8, 27, 16,  5])

Negative values raised to a non-integral value will result in ``nan``
(and a warning will be generated).

>>> x3 = np.array([-1.0, -4.0])
>>> with np.errstate(invalid='ignore'):
...     p = np.power(x3, 1.5)
...
>>> p
array([nan, nan])

To get complex results, give the argument ``dtype=complex``.

>>> np.power(x3, 1.5, dtype=complex)
array([-1.83697020e-16-1.j, -1.46957616e-15-8.j])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
Cube each element in an array.

>>> x1 = np.arange(6)
>>> x1
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> np.power(x1, 3)
array([  0,   1,   8,  27,  64, 125])

Raise the bases to different exponents.

>>> x2 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]
>>> np.power(x1, x2)
array([  0.,   1.,   8.,  27.,  16.,   5.])

The effect of broadcasting.

>>> x2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]])
>>> x2
array([[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1],
       [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]])
>>> np.power(x1, x2)
array([[ 0,  1,  8, 27, 16,  5],
       [ 0,  1,  8, 27, 16,  5]])

The ``**`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.power`` on
ndarrays.

>>> x2 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1])
>>> x1 = np.arange(6)
>>> x1 ** x2
array([ 0,  1,  8, 27, 16,  5])

(and a warning will be generated).

>>> x3 = np.array([-1.0, -4.0])
>>> with np.errstate(invalid='ignore'):
...     p = np.power(x3, 1.5)
...
>>> p

>>> np.power(x3, 1.5, dtype=complex)
array([-1.83697020e-16-1.j, -1.46957616e-15-8.j])

Raising zero to a negative power.

>>> np.power(0, -2)

I decided to add the last example because it demonstrates the behavior of the power function when the base is zero and the exponent is negative. This is an important edge case that users should be aware of.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a wide range of use cases, including basic usage, broadcasting, and handling of special values like negative numbers and zero. The additional example I added provides further insight into the behavior of the power function in a specific edge case.
