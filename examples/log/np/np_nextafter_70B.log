I will provide you with the docstring for the nextafter function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nextafter. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

nextafter(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Return the next floating-point value after x1 towards x2, element-wise.

Parameters
----------
x1 : array_like
    Values to find the next representable value of.
x2 : array_like
    The direction where to look for the next representable value of `x1`.
    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
out : ndarray or scalar
    The next representable values of `x1` in the direction of `x2`.
    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

Examples
--------
>>> eps = np.finfo(np.float64).eps
>>> np.nextafter(1, 2) == eps + 1
True
>>> np.nextafter([1, 2], [2, 1]) == [eps + 1, 2 - eps]
array([ True,  True])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

Examples
--------
>>> eps = np.finfo(np.float64).eps
>>> np.nextafter(1, 2) == eps + 1
True
>>> np.nextafter([1, 2], [2, 1]) == [eps + 1, 2 - eps]
array([ True,  True])
Next representable value with negative numbers:
 
>>> np.nextafter(-1, -2) == -1 - eps
True
