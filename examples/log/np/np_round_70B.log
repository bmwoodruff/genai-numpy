I will provide you with the docstring for the round function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.round. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Evenly round to the given number of decimals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    decimals : int, optional
        Number of decimal places to round to (default: 0).  If
        decimals is negative, it specifies the number of positions to
        the left of the decimal point.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
        values will be cast if necessary. See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type`
        for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    rounded_array : ndarray
        An array of the same type as `a`, containing the rounded values.
        Unless `out` was specified, a new array is created.  A reference to
        the result is returned.

        The real and imaginary parts of complex numbers are rounded
        separately.  The result of rounding a float is a float.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.round : equivalent method
    around : an alias for this function
    ceil, fix, floor, rint, trunc


    Notes
    -----
    For values exactly halfway between rounded decimal values, NumPy
    rounds to the nearest even value. Thus 1.5 and 2.5 round to 2.0,
    -0.5 and 0.5 round to 0.0, etc.

    ``np.round`` uses a fast but sometimes inexact algorithm to round
    floating-point datatypes. For positive `decimals` it is equivalent to
    ``np.true_divide(np.rint(a * 10**decimals), 10**decimals)``, which has
    error due to the inexact representation of decimal fractions in the IEEE
    floating point standard [1]_ and errors introduced when scaling by powers
    of ten. For instance, note the extra "1" in the following:

        >>> np.round(56294995342131.5, 3)
        56294995342131.51

    If your goal is to print such values with a fixed number of decimals, it is
    preferable to use numpy's float printing routines to limit the number of
    printed decimals:

        >>> np.format_float_positional(56294995342131.5, precision=3)
        '56294995342131.5'

    The float printing routines use an accurate but much more computationally
    demanding algorithm to compute the number of digits after the decimal
    point.

    Alternatively, Python's builtin `round` function uses a more accurate
    but slower algorithm for 64-bit floating point values:

        >>> round(56294995342131.5, 3)
        56294995342131.5
        >>> np.round(16.055, 2), round(16.055, 2)  # equals 16.0549999999999997
        (16.06, 16.05)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.round([0.37, 1.64])
    array([0., 2.])
    >>> np.round([0.37, 1.64], decimals=1)
    array([0.4, 1.6])
    >>> np.round([.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]) # rounds to nearest even value
    array([0., 2., 2., 4., 4.])
    >>> np.round([1,2,3,11], decimals=1) # ndarray of ints is returned
    array([ 1,  2,  3, 11])
    >>> np.round([1,2,3,11], decimals=-1)
    array([ 0,  0,  0, 10])
    Rounding complex numbers:
    >>> np.round([1.5 + 1.5j, 2.5 + 2.5j])
    array([2.+2.j, 2.+2.j])

I decided to add an example that demonstrates how `np.round` handles complex numbers. This is an important aspect of the function's behavior that was not previously covered in the examples. I stopped here because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including rounding to different decimal places, handling of halfway values, and the behavior with integer and floating-point inputs. The new example provides additional context for users working with complex numbers.
