I will provide you with the docstring for the putmask function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.putmask. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    putmask(a, mask, values)

    Changes elements of an array based on conditional and input values.

    Sets ``a.flat[n] = values[n]`` for each n where ``mask.flat[n]==True``.

    If `values` is not the same size as `a` and `mask` then it will repeat.
    This gives behavior different from ``a[mask] = values``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Target array.
    mask : array_like
        Boolean mask array. It has to be the same shape as `a`.
    values : array_like
        Values to put into `a` where `mask` is True. If `values` is smaller
        than `a` it will be repeated.

    See Also
    --------
    place, put, take, copyto

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
    >>> np.putmask(x, x>2, x**2)
    >>> x
    array([[ 0,  1,  2],
           [ 9, 16, 25]])

    If `values` is smaller than `a` it is repeated:

    >>> x = np.arange(5)
    >>> np.putmask(x, x>1, [-33, -44])
    >>> x
    array([  0,   1, -33, -44, -33])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    putmask(a, mask, values)

    Changes elements of an array based on conditional and input values.

    Sets ``a.flat[n] = values[n]`` for each n where ``mask.flat[n]==True``.

    If `values` is not the same size as `a` and `mask` then it will repeat.
    This gives behavior different from ``a[mask] = values``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Target array.
    mask : array_like
        Boolean mask array. It has to be the same shape as `a`.
    values : array_like
        Values to put into `a` where `mask` is True. If `values` is smaller
        than `a` it will be repeated.

    See Also
    --------
    place, put, take, copyto

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
    >>> np.putmask(x, x>2, x**2)
    >>> x
    array([[ 0,  1,  2],
           [ 9, 16, 25]])

    If `values` is smaller than `a` it is repeated:

    >>> x = np.arange(5)
    >>> np.putmask(x, x>1, [-33, -44])
    >>> x
    array([  0,   1, -33, -44, -33])

    Using a 2D mask:

    >>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
    >>> mask = np.array([[True, False, True], [False, True, False]])
    >>> np.putmask(x, mask, 100)
    >>> x
    array([[  0,   1, 100],
           [  3, 100,   5]])

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only demonstrate the use of `np.putmask` with a 1D mask, but the function can also be used with a 2D mask. This example shows how to use a 2D mask to selectively replace elements in a 2D array.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.putmask`, and the new example demonstrates an additional use case. Adding more examples would likely be redundant and may make the documentation more cluttered.
