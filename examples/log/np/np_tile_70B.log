I will provide you with the docstring for the tile function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.tile. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Construct an array by repeating A the number of times given by reps.

    If `reps` has length ``d``, the result will have dimension of
    ``max(d, A.ndim)``.

    If ``A.ndim < d``, `A` is promoted to be d-dimensional by prepending new
    axes. So a shape (3,) array is promoted to (1, 3) for 2-D replication,
    or shape (1, 1, 3) for 3-D replication. If this is not the desired
    behavior, promote `A` to d-dimensions manually before calling this
    function.

    If ``A.ndim > d``, `reps` is promoted to `A`.ndim by prepending 1's to it.
    Thus for an `A` of shape (2, 3, 4, 5), a `reps` of (2, 2) is treated as
    (1, 1, 2, 2).

    Note : Although tile may be used for broadcasting, it is strongly
    recommended to use numpy's broadcasting operations and functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array_like
        The input array.
    reps : array_like
        The number of repetitions of `A` along each axis.

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        The tiled output array.

    See Also
    --------
    repeat : Repeat elements of an array.
    broadcast_to : Broadcast an array to a new shape

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([0, 1, 2])
    >>> np.tile(a, 2)
    array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
    >>> np.tile(a, (2, 2))
    array([[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2],
           [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]])
    >>> np.tile(a, (2, 1, 2))
    array([[[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]],
           [[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]]])

    >>> b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.tile(b, 2)
    array([[1, 2, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 3, 4]])
    >>> np.tile(b, (2, 1))
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [1, 2],
           [3, 4]])

    >>> c = np.array([1,2,3,4])
    >>> np.tile(c,(4,1))
    array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
           [1, 2, 3, 4],
           [1, 2, 3, 4],
           [1, 2, 3, 4]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Construct an array by repeating A the number of times given by reps.

    If `reps` has length ``d``, the result will have dimension of
    ``max(d, A.ndim)``.

    If ``A.ndim < d``, `A` is promoted to be d-dimensional by prepending new
    axes. So a shape (3,) array is promoted to (1, 3) for 2-D replication,
    or shape (1, 1, 3) for 3-D replication. If this is not the desired
    behavior, promote `A` to d-dimensions manually before calling this
    function.

    If ``A.ndim > d``, `reps` is promoted to `A`.ndim by prepending 1's to it.
    Thus for an `A` of shape (2, 3, 4, 5), a `reps` of (2, 2) is treated as
    (1, 1, 2, 2).

    Note : Although tile may be used for broadcasting, it is strongly
    recommended to use numpy's broadcasting operations and functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array_like
        The input array.
    reps : array_like
        The number of repetitions of `A` along each axis.

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        The tiled output array.

    array([[[1, 2, 1, 2],
