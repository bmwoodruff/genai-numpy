You are a helpful assistant working to improve the NumPy documentation. Use numpydoc style guidelines.

I will provide you with the docstring for the roots function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.roots. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the roots of a polynomial with coefficients given in p.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    The values in the rank-1 array `p` are coefficients of a polynomial.
    If the length of `p` is n+1 then the polynomial is described by::

      p[0] * x**n + p[1] * x**(n-1) + ... + p[n-1]*x + p[n]

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : array_like
        Rank-1 array of polynomial coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        An array containing the roots of the polynomial.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When `p` cannot be converted to a rank-1 array.

    See also
    --------
    poly : Find the coefficients of a polynomial with a given sequence
           of roots.
    polyval : Compute polynomial values.
    polyfit : Least squares polynomial fit.
    poly1d : A one-dimensional polynomial class.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm relies on computing the eigenvalues of the
    companion matrix [1]_.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> coeff = [3.2, 2, 1]
    >>> np.roots(coeff)
    array([-0.3125+0.46351241j, -0.3125-0.46351241j])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> coeff = [3.2, 2, 1]
    >>> np.roots(coeff)
    array([-0.3125+0.46351241j, -0.3125-0.46351241j])

    Real roots example:
    >>> coeff = [1, -4, 4]
    >>> np.roots(coeff)
    array([2., 2.])
