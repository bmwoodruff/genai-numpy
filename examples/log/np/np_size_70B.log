I will provide you with the docstring for the size function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.size. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the number of elements along a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the elements are counted.  By default, give
        the total number of elements.

    Returns
    -------
    element_count : int
        Number of elements along the specified axis.

    See Also
    --------
    shape : dimensions of array
    ndarray.shape : dimensions of array
    ndarray.size : number of elements in array

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
    >>> np.size(a)
    6
    >>> np.size(a,1)
    3
    >>> np.size(a,0)
    2

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
    >>> np.size(a)
    6
    >>> np.size(a,1)
    3
    >>> np.size(a,0)
    2
    Single element array:
    >>> a = np.array([5])
    >>> np.size(a)
    1

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the behavior of `np.size` when the input array has only one element. This is a common use case, and it's useful to show that `np.size` returns 1 in this scenario.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of `np.size`: getting the total number of elements, and getting the number of elements along a specific axis. The additional example I added provides further clarity on the behavior of `np.size` with a single-element array. Adding more examples at this point would likely be redundant or unnecessary.
