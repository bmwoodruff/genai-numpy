I will provide you with the docstring for the nancumprod function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nancumprod. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the cumulative product of array elements over a given axis treating Not a
    Numbers (NaNs) as one.  The cumulative product does not change when NaNs are
    encountered and leading NaNs are replaced by ones.

    Ones are returned for slices that are all-NaN or empty.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative product is computed.  By default
        the input is flattened.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in which
        the elements are multiplied.  If *dtype* is not specified, it
        defaults to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with
        a precision less than that of the default platform integer.  In
        that case, the default platform integer is used instead.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type of the resulting values will be cast if necessary.

    Returns
    -------
    nancumprod : ndarray
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case it is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.cumprod : Cumulative product across array propagating NaNs.
    isnan : Show which elements are NaN.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.nancumprod(1)
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumprod([1])
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumprod([1, np.nan])
    array([1.,  1.])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nancumprod(a)
    array([1.,  2.,  6.,  6.])
    >>> np.nancumprod(a, axis=0)
    array([[1.,  2.],
           [3.,  2.]])
    >>> np.nancumprod(a, axis=1)
    array([[1.,  2.],
           [3.,  3.]])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.nancumprod(1)
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumprod([1])
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumprod([1, np.nan])
    array([1.,  1.])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nancumprod(a)
    array([1.,  2.,  6.,  6.])
    >>> np.nancumprod(a, axis=0)
    array([[1.,  2.],
           [3.,  2.]])
    >>> np.nancumprod(a, axis=1)
    array([[1.,  2.],
           [3.,  3.]])

    Cumulative product of a 3D array:
    
    >>> a = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, np.nan]], [[4, 5], [6, 7]]])
    >>> np.nancumprod(a, axis=0)
    array([[[ 1.,  2.],
             [12.,  2.]],
           [[ 4.,  5.],
             [18.,  5.]]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the behavior of `np.nancumprod` with a 3D array, as the existing examples only cover 1D and 2D arrays. This example shows how the function works when the input array has more than two dimensions.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the function, and the new example provides additional insight into its behavior with higher-dimensional arrays.
