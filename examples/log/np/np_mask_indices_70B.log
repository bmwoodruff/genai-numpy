I will provide you with the docstring for the mask_indices function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.mask_indices. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the indices to access (n, n) arrays, given a masking function.

    Assume `mask_func` is a function that, for a square array a of size
    ``(n, n)`` with a possible offset argument `k`, when called as
    ``mask_func(a, k)`` returns a new array with zeros in certain locations
    (functions like `triu` or `tril` do precisely this). Then this function
    returns the indices where the non-zero values would be located.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The returned indices will be valid to access arrays of shape (n, n).
    mask_func : callable
        A function whose call signature is similar to that of `triu`, `tril`.
        That is, ``mask_func(x, k)`` returns a boolean array, shaped like `x`.
        `k` is an optional argument to the function.
    k : scalar
        An optional argument which is passed through to `mask_func`. Functions
        like `triu`, `tril` take a second argument that is interpreted as an
        offset.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : tuple of arrays.
        The `n` arrays of indices corresponding to the locations where
        ``mask_func(np.ones((n, n)), k)`` is True.

    See Also
    --------
    triu, tril, triu_indices, tril_indices

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    Examples
    --------
    These are the indices that would allow you to access the upper triangular
    part of any 3x3 array:

    >>> iu = np.mask_indices(3, np.triu)

    For example, if `a` is a 3x3 array:

    >>> a = np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])
    >>> a[iu]
    array([0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8])

    An offset can be passed also to the masking function.  This gets us the
    indices starting on the first diagonal right of the main one:

    >>> iu1 = np.mask_indices(3, np.triu, 1)

    with which we now extract only three elements:

    >>> a[iu1]
    array([1, 2, 5])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    These are the indices that would allow you to access the upper triangular
    part of any 3x3 array:

    >>> iu = np.mask_indices(3, np.triu)

    For example, if `a` is a 3x3 array:

    >>> a = np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])
    >>> a[iu]
    array([0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8])

    An offset can be passed also to the masking function.  This gets us the
    indices starting on the first diagonal right of the main one:

    >>> iu1 = np.mask_indices(3, np.triu, 1)

    with which we now extract only three elements:

    >>> a[iu1]
    array([1, 2, 5])

    Accessing the lower triangular part of a 4x4 array:

    
    >>> il = np.mask_indices(4, np.tril)

    If `b` is a 4x4 array:

    >>> b = np.arange(16).reshape(4, 4)
    >>> b
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
           [12, 13, 14, 15]])
    >>> b[il]
    array([ 0,  4,  5,  8,  9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15])

I decided to add an example to show how to access the lower triangular part of a square array, as it is a common use case for this function. This example complements the existing examples that demonstrate accessing the upper triangular part.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of the function, and the additional example provides further clarity on how to use the function for a different scenario.
