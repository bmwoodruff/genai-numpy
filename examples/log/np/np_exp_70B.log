I will provide you with the docstring for the exp function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.exp. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

exp(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Calculate the exponential of all elements in the input array.

Parameters
----------
x : array_like
    Input values.
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
out : ndarray or scalar
    Output array, element-wise exponential of `x`.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

See Also
--------
expm1 : Calculate ``exp(x) - 1`` for all elements in the array.
exp2  : Calculate ``2**x`` for all elements in the array.

Notes
-----
The irrational number ``e`` is also known as Euler's number.  It is
approximately 2.718281, and is the base of the natural logarithm,
``ln`` (this means that, if :math:`x = \ln y = \log_e y`,
then :math:`e^x = y`. For real input, ``exp(x)`` is always positive.

For complex arguments, ``x = a + ib``, we can write
:math:`e^x = e^a e^{ib}`.  The first term, :math:`e^a`, is already
known (it is the real argument, described above).  The second term,
:math:`e^{ib}`, is :math:`\cos b + i \sin b`, a function with
magnitude 1 and a periodic phase.

Examples
--------
Plot the magnitude and phase of ``exp(x)`` in the complex plane:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

>>> x = np.linspace(-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 100)
>>> xx = x + 1j * x[:, np.newaxis] # a + ib over complex plane
>>> out = np.exp(xx)

>>> plt.subplot(121)
>>> plt.imshow(np.abs(out),
...            extent=[-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, -2*np.pi, 2*np.pi], cmap='gray')
>>> plt.title('Magnitude of exp(x)')

>>> plt.subplot(122)
>>> plt.imshow(np.angle(out),
...            extent=[-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, -2*np.pi, 2*np.pi], cmap='hsv')
>>> plt.title('Phase (angle) of exp(x)')
>>> plt.show()

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
Plot the magnitude and phase of ``exp(x)`` in the complex plane:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

>>> x = np.linspace(-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 100)
>>> xx = x + 1j * x[:, np.newaxis] # a + ib over complex plane
>>> out = np.exp(xx)

>>> plt.subplot(121)
>>> plt.imshow(np.abs(out),
...            extent=[-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, -2*np.pi, 2*np.pi], cmap='gray')
>>> plt.title('Magnitude of exp(x)')

>>> plt.subplot(122)
>>> plt.imshow(np.angle(out),
...            extent=[-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, -2*np.pi, 2*np.pi], cmap='hsv')
>>> plt.title('Phase (angle) of exp(x)')
>>> plt.show()

Simple exponential calculation:

>>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
>>> y = np.exp(x)
>>> y
array([ 2.71828183,  7.3890561 , 20.08553692])

I decided to add the second example because the first example is quite complex and involves plotting the magnitude and phase of `exp(x)` in the complex plane. The second example provides a simple illustration of how `np.exp` can be used to calculate the exponential of a given array of numbers. This example is more accessible to users who may not be familiar with complex numbers or plotting.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already provides a comprehensive illustration of the function's behavior in the complex plane, and the additional example provides a simple and intuitive demonstration of the function's basic usage.
