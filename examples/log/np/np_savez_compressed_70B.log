I will provide you with the docstring for the savez_compressed function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.savez_compressed. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Save several arrays into a single file in compressed ``.npz`` format.

    Provide arrays as keyword arguments to store them under the
    corresponding name in the output file: ``savez_compressed(fn, x=x, y=y)``.

    If arrays are specified as positional arguments, i.e.,
    ``savez_compressed(fn, x, y)``, their names will be `arr_0`, `arr_1`, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : file, str, or pathlib.Path
        Either the filename (string) or an open file (file-like object)
        where the data will be saved. If file is a string or a Path, the
        ``.npz`` extension will be appended to the filename if it is not
        already there.
    args : Arguments, optional
        Arrays to save to the file. Please use keyword arguments (see
        `kwds` below) to assign names to arrays.  Arrays specified as
        args will be named "arr_0", "arr_1", and so on.
    kwds : Keyword arguments, optional
        Arrays to save to the file. Each array will be saved to the
        output file with its corresponding keyword name.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.save : Save a single array to a binary file in NumPy format.
    numpy.savetxt : Save an array to a file as plain text.
    numpy.savez : Save several arrays into an uncompressed ``.npz`` file format
    numpy.load : Load the files created by savez_compressed.

    Notes
    -----
    The ``.npz`` file format is a zipped archive of files named after the
    variables they contain.  The archive is compressed with
    ``zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED`` and each file in the archive contains one variable
    in ``.npy`` format. For a description of the ``.npy`` format, see
    :py:mod:`numpy.lib.format`.


    When opening the saved ``.npz`` file with `load` a `~lib.npyio.NpzFile`
    object is returned. This is a dictionary-like object which can be queried
    for its list of arrays (with the ``.files`` attribute), and for the arrays
    themselves.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> test_array = np.random.rand(3, 2)
    >>> test_vector = np.random.rand(4)
    >>> np.savez_compressed('/tmp/123', a=test_array, b=test_vector)
    >>> loaded = np.load('/tmp/123.npz')
    >>> print(np.array_equal(test_array, loaded['a']))
    True
    >>> print(np.array_equal(test_vector, loaded['b']))
    True

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Save several arrays into a single file in compressed ``.npz`` format.

    Provide arrays as keyword arguments to store them under the
    corresponding name in the output file: ``savez_compressed(fn, x=x, y=y)``.

    ``savez_compressed(fn, x, y)``, their names will be `arr_0`, `arr_1`, etc.

        Either the filename (string) or an open file (file-like object)
