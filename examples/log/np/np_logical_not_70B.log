I will provide you with the docstring for the logical_not function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.logical_not. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

logical_not(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Compute the truth value of NOT x element-wise.

Parameters
----------
x : array_like
    Logical NOT is applied to the elements of `x`.
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : bool or ndarray of bool
    Boolean result with the same shape as `x` of the NOT operation
    on elements of `x`.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

See Also
--------
logical_and, logical_or, logical_xor

Examples
--------
>>> np.logical_not(3)
False
>>> np.logical_not([True, False, 0, 1])
array([False,  True,  True, False])

>>> x = np.arange(5)
>>> np.logical_not(x<3)
array([False, False, False,  True,  True])
assistant

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.logical_not(3)
False
>>> np.logical_not([True, False, 0, 1])
array([False,  True,  True, False])

>>> x = np.arange(5)
>>> np.logical_not(x<3)
array([False, False, False,  True,  True])

Boolean arrays with different shapes:
 
>>> np.logical_not(np.array([[True, False], [False, True]]))
array([[False,  True],
       [ True, False]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the behavior of `np.logical_not` with a 2D boolean array, as the existing examples only show its behavior with scalar and 1D arrays. This additional example helps to illustrate the function's behavior in a more general context.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic behavior of `np.logical_not` with scalar and 1D arrays, and the additional example I added covers its behavior with a 2D array. Further examples would likely be redundant or too specific, and might not add significant value to the documentation.
