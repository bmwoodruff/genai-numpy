I will provide you with the docstring for the vstack function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.vstack. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise).

    This is equivalent to concatenation along the first axis after 1-D arrays
    of shape `(N,)` have been reshaped to `(1,N)`. Rebuilds arrays divided by
    `vsplit`.

    This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
    instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),
    and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` and
    `block` provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tup : sequence of ndarrays
        The arrays must have the same shape along all but the first axis.
        1-D arrays must have the same length.

    dtype : str or dtype
        If provided, the destination array will have this dtype. Cannot be
        provided together with `out`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.24

    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur. Defaults to 'same_kind'.

        .. versionadded:: 1.24

    Returns
    -------
    stacked : ndarray
        The array formed by stacking the given arrays, will be at least 2-D.

    See Also
    --------
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
    stack : Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
    block : Assemble an nd-array from nested lists of blocks.
    hstack : Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).
    dstack : Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).
    column_stack : Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
    vsplit : Split an array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row-wise).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.vstack((a,b))
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])

    >>> a = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])
    >>> b = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
    >>> np.vstack((a,b))
    array([[1],
           [2],
           [3],
           [4],
           [5],
           [6]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.vstack((a,b))
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])

    >>> a = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])
    >>> b = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
    >>> np.vstack((a,b))
    array([[1],
           [2],
           [3],
           [4],
           [5],
           [6]])

    Stacking 2D arrays with different shapes:
    
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> b = np.array([[5, 6]])
    >>> np.vstack((a,b))
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [5, 6]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the behavior of `vstack` when stacking 2D arrays with different shapes. This is an important use case that is not covered by the existing examples.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `vstack` with 1D and 2D arrays, and the new example provides additional insight into the function's behavior with arrays of different shapes.
