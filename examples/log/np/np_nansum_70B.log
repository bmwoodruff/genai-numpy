I will provide you with the docstring for the nansum function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nansum. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the sum of array elements over a given axis treating Not a
    Numbers (NaNs) as zero.

    In NumPy versions <= 1.9.0 Nan is returned for slices that are all-NaN or
    empty. In later versions zero is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose sum is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the sum is computed. The default is to compute the
        sum of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  By default, the dtype of `a` is used.  An
        exception is when `a` has an integer type with less precision than
        the platform (u)intp. In that case, the default will be either
        (u)int32 or (u)int64 depending on whether the platform is 32 or 64
        bits. For inexact inputs, dtype must be inexact.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``. If provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.  See
        :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details. The casting of NaN to integer
        can yield unexpected results.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.


        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `mean` or `sum` methods
        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    initial : scalar, optional
        Starting value for the sum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the sum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    nansum : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which it is returned. The result has the same
        size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if `axis` is not None
        or `a` is a 1-d array.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.sum : Sum across array propagating NaNs.
    isnan : Show which elements are NaN.
    isfinite : Show which elements are not NaN or +/-inf.

    Notes
    -----
    If both positive and negative infinity are present, the sum will be Not
    A Number (NaN).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.nansum(1)
    1
    >>> np.nansum([1])
    1
    >>> np.nansum([1, np.nan])
    1.0
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 1], [1, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nansum(a)
    3.0
    >>> np.nansum(a, axis=0)
    array([2.,  1.])
    >>> np.nansum([1, np.nan, np.inf])
    inf
    >>> np.nansum([1, np.nan, -np.inf])
    -inf
    >>> from numpy.testing import suppress_warnings
    >>> with np.errstate(invalid="ignore"):
    ...     np.nansum([1, np.nan, np.inf, -np.inf]) # both +/- infinity present
    np.float64(nan)

    --------
    >>> np.nansum(1)
    1
    >>> np.nansum([1])
    1
    >>> np.nansum([1, np.nan])
    1.0
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 1], [1, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nansum(a)
    3.0
    >>> np.nansum(a, axis=0)
    array([2.,  1.])
    >>> np.nansum([1, np.nan, np.inf])
    inf
    >>> np.nansum([1, np.nan, -np.inf])
    -inf
    >>> from numpy.testing import suppress_warnings
    >>> with np.errstate(invalid="ignore"):
    ...     np.nansum([1, np.nan, np.inf, -np.inf]) # both +/- infinity present
    np.float64(nan)
    Summing a multi-dimensional array with NaNs:
    
    >>> a = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, np.nan]]])
    >>> np.nansum(a, axis=(0, 1))
