I will provide you with the docstring for the deg2rad function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.deg2rad. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

deg2rad(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Convert angles from degrees to radians.

Parameters
----------
x : array_like
    Angles in degrees.
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray
    The corresponding angle in radians.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

See Also
--------
rad2deg : Convert angles from radians to degrees.
unwrap : Remove large jumps in angle by wrapping.

Notes
-----
.. versionadded:: 1.3.0

``deg2rad(x)`` is ``x * pi / 180``.

Examples
--------
>>> np.deg2rad(180)
3.1415926535897931

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

```
Examples
--------
>>> np.deg2rad(180)
3.1415926535897931

Converting a list of angles:
 
>>> np.deg2rad([0, 30, 45, 90, 135])
[0.         , 0.52359878, 0.78539816, 1.57079633, 2.35619449]
```

I decided to add an example that demonstrates how the `deg2rad` function can be used to convert a list of angles from degrees to radians. This example shows how the function can be used with a list of input values, which is a common use case.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic usage of the function, and the additional example I added shows how it can be used with a list of input values. Further examples may not add significant value to the documentation, and may even make it more cluttered and harder to read.
