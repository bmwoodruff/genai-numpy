I will provide you with the docstring for the einsum_path function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.einsum_path. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    einsum_path(subscripts, *operands, optimize='greedy')

    Evaluates the lowest cost contraction order for an einsum expression by
    considering the creation of intermediate arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subscripts : str
        Specifies the subscripts for summation.
    *operands : list of array_like
        These are the arrays for the operation.
    optimize : {bool, list, tuple, 'greedy', 'optimal'}
        Choose the type of path. If a tuple is provided, the second argument is
        assumed to be the maximum intermediate size created. If only a single
        argument is provided the largest input or output array size is used
        as a maximum intermediate size.

        * if a list is given that starts with ``einsum_path``, uses this as the
          contraction path
        * if False no optimization is taken
        * if True defaults to the 'greedy' algorithm
        * 'optimal' An algorithm that combinatorially explores all possible
          ways of contracting the listed tensors and chooses the least costly
          path. Scales exponentially with the number of terms in the
          contraction.
        * 'greedy' An algorithm that chooses the best pair contraction
          at each step. Effectively, this algorithm searches the largest inner,
          Hadamard, and then outer products at each step. Scales cubically with
          the number of terms in the contraction. Equivalent to the 'optimal'
          path for most contractions.

        Default is 'greedy'.

    Returns
    -------
    path : list of tuples
        A list representation of the einsum path.
    string_repr : str
        A printable representation of the einsum path.

    Notes
    -----
    The resulting path indicates which terms of the input contraction should be
    contracted first, the result of this contraction is then appended to the
    end of the contraction list. This list can then be iterated over until all
    intermediate contractions are complete.

    Examples
    --------

    We can begin with a chain dot example. In this case, it is optimal to
    contract the ``b`` and ``c`` tensors first as represented by the first
    element of the path ``(1, 2)``. The resulting tensor is added to the end
    of the contraction and the remaining contraction ``(0, 1)`` is then
    completed.
