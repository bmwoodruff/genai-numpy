I will provide you with the docstring for the eye function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.eye. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return a 2-D array with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
      Number of rows in the output.
    M : int, optional
      Number of columns in the output. If None, defaults to `N`.
    k : int, optional
      Index of the diagonal: 0 (the default) refers to the main diagonal,
      a positive value refers to an upper diagonal, and a negative value
      to a lower diagonal.
    dtype : data-type, optional
      Data-type of the returned array.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Whether the output should be stored in row-major (C-style) or
        column-major (Fortran-style) order in memory.

        .. versionadded:: 1.14.0
    device : str, optional
        The device on which to place the created array. Default: None.
        For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``"cpu"`` if passed.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    I : ndarray of shape (N,M)
      An array where all elements are equal to zero, except for the `k`-th
      diagonal, whose values are equal to one.

    See Also
    --------
    identity : (almost) equivalent function
    diag : diagonal 2-D array from a 1-D array specified by the user.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.eye(2, dtype=int)
    array([[1, 0],
           [0, 1]])
    >>> np.eye(3, k=1)
    array([[0.,  1.,  0.],
           [0.,  0.,  1.],
           [0.,  0.,  0.]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.eye(2, dtype=int)
    array([[1, 0],
           [0, 1]])
    >>> np.eye(3, k=1)
    array([[0.,  1.,  0.],
           [0.,  0.,  1.],
           [0.,  0.,  0.]])
    Creating a 4x4 matrix with a lower diagonal:
    
    >>> np.eye(4, k=-1)
    array([[0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [0.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
           [0.,  0.,  1.,  0.]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the creation of a matrix with a lower diagonal, which is a common use case for the `eye` function. This example helps to illustrate the behavior of the `k` parameter, which can be negative to specify a lower diagonal.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the `eye` function, including specifying the data type and the `k` parameter. The additional example I added provides further clarification on the behavior of the `k` parameter, but further examples may not add significant value to the documentation.
