I will provide you with the docstring for the fromfile function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fromfile. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

fromfile(file, dtype=float, count=-1, sep='', offset=0, *, like=None)

    Construct an array from data in a text or binary file.

    A highly efficient way of reading binary data with a known data-type,
    as well as parsing simply formatted text files.  Data written using the
    `tofile` method can be read using this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : file or str or Path
        Open file object or filename.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.17.0
            `pathlib.Path` objects are now accepted.

    dtype : data-type
        Data type of the returned array.
        For binary files, it is used to determine the size and byte-order
        of the items in the file.
        Most builtin numeric types are supported and extension types may be supported.

        .. versionadded:: 1.18.0
            Complex dtypes.

    count : int
        Number of items to read. ``-1`` means all items (i.e., the complete
        file).
    sep : str
        Separator between items if file is a text file.
        Empty ("") separator means the file should be treated as binary.
        Spaces (" ") in the separator match zero or more whitespace characters.
        A separator consisting only of spaces must match at least one
        whitespace.
    offset : int
        The offset (in bytes) from the file's current position. Defaults to 0.
        Only permitted for binary files.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17.0
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Notes
    -----
    Do not rely on the combination of `tofile` and `fromfile` for
    data storage, as the binary files generated are not platform
    independent.  In particular, no byte-order or data-type information is
    saved.  Data can be stored in the platform independent ``.npy`` format
    using `save` and `load` instead.

    Examples
    --------
    Construct an ndarray:

    >>> dt = np.dtype([('time', [('min', np.int64), ('sec', np.int64)]),
    ...                ('temp', float)])
    >>> x = np.zeros((1,), dtype=dt)
    >>> x['time']['min'] = 10; x['temp'] = 98.25
    >>> x
    array([((10, 0), 98.25)],
          dtype=[('time', [('min', '<i8'), ('sec', '<i8')]), ('temp', '<f8')])

    Save the raw data to disk:

    >>> import tempfile
    >>> fname = tempfile.mkstemp()[1]
    >>> x.tofile(fname)

    Read the raw data from disk:

    >>> np.fromfile(fname, dtype=dt)
    array([((10, 0), 98.25)],
          dtype=[('time', [('min', '<i8'), ('sec', '<i8')]), ('temp', '<f8')])

    The recommended way to store and load data:

    >>> np.save(fname, x)
    >>> np.load(fname + '.npy')
    array([((10, 0), 98.25)],
          dtype=[('time', [('min', '<i8'), ('sec', '<i8')]), ('temp', '<f8')])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    Construct an ndarray:

    >>> dt = np.dtype([('time', [('min', np.int64), ('sec', np.int64)]),
    ...                ('temp', float)])
    >>> x = np.zeros((1,), dtype=dt)
    >>> x['time']['min'] = 10; x['temp'] = 98.25
    >>> x
    array([((10, 0), 98.25)],
          dtype=[('time', [('min', '<i8'), ('sec', '<i8')]), ('temp', '<f8')])

    Save the raw data to disk:

    >>> import tempfile
    >>> fname = tempfile.mkstemp()[1]
    >>> x.tofile(fname)

    Read the raw data from disk:

    >>> np.fromfile(fname, dtype=dt)
    array([((10, 0), 98.25)],
          dtype=[('time', [('min', '<i8'), ('sec', '<i8')]), ('temp', '<f8')])

    The recommended way to store and load data:

    >>> np.save(fname, x)
    >>> np.load(fname + '.npy')
    array([((10, 0), 98.25)],
          dtype=[('time', [('min', '<i8'), ('sec', '<i8')]), ('temp', '<f8')])

    Reading from a text file:

    >>> with open('temp.txt', 'w') as f:
    ...     f.write('1 2 3\n4 5 6')
    >>> np.fromfile('temp.txt', dtype=int, sep=' ')
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how to read from a text file using `np.fromfile`. This example shows how to create a text file with data separated by spaces, and then read that data into an array using `np.fromfile` with the `sep` parameter set to a space.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.fromfile` with binary files, and the new example covers the usage with text files. The additional example provides a clear demonstration of how to use `np.fromfile` in a different context, making the documentation more comprehensive and helpful for users.
