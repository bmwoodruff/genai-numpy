I will provide you with the docstring for the nanmean function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nanmean. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axis, ignoring NaNs.

    Returns the average of the array elements.  The average is taken over
    the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
    `float64` intermediate and return values are used for integer inputs.

    For all-NaN slices, NaN is returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose mean is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the means are computed. The default is to compute
        the mean of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the mean.  For integer inputs, the default
        is `float64`; for inexact inputs, it is the same as the input
        dtype.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.
        See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `mean` or `sum` methods
        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the mean. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    m : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out=None`, returns a new array containing the mean values,
        otherwise a reference to the output array is returned. Nan is
        returned for slices that contain only NaNs.

    See Also
    --------
    average : Weighted average
    mean : Arithmetic mean taken while not ignoring NaNs
    var, nanvar

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the non-NaN elements along the axis
    divided by the number of non-NaN elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32`.  Specifying a
    higher-precision accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can alleviate
    this issue.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.nanmean(a)
    2.6666666666666665
    >>> np.nanmean(a, axis=0)
    array([2.,  4.])
    >>> np.nanmean(a, axis=1)
    array([1.,  3.5]) # may vary

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.nanmean(a)
    2.6666666666666665
    >>> np.nanmean(a, axis=0)
    array([2.,  4.])
    >>> np.nanmean(a, axis=1)
    array([1.,  3.5]) # may vary
    Single element array: 
    >>> np.nanmean([np.nan])
    nan

I decided to add an example to show the behavior of `np.nanmean` when the input array contains a single NaN element. This is an edge case that is not covered by the existing examples, and it is useful to know that `np.nanmean` returns NaN in this situation.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of `np.nanmean`, including computing the mean of a 2D array, computing the mean along a specific axis, and computing the mean of a 1D array. The additional example I added covers a specific edge case, and further examples would likely be redundant or cover even more niche scenarios.
