I will provide you with the docstring for the nanmedian function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nanmedian. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the median along the specified axis, while ignoring NaNs.

    Returns the median of the array elements.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : {int, sequence of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the medians are computed. The default
        is to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.
        A sequence of axes is supported since version 1.9.0.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
       If True, then allow use of memory of input array `a` for
       calculations. The input array will be modified by the call to
       `median`. This will save memory when you do not need to preserve
       the contents of the input array. Treat the input as undefined,
       but it will probably be fully or partially sorted. Default is
       False. If `overwrite_input` is ``True`` and `a` is not already an
       `ndarray`, an error will be raised.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
        through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
        `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    Returns
    -------
    median : ndarray
        A new array holding the result. If the input contains integers
        or floats smaller than ``float64``, then the output data-type is
        ``np.float64``.  Otherwise, the data-type of the output is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    mean, median, percentile

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the median of ``V`` is the
    middle value of a sorted copy of ``V``, ``V_sorted`` - i.e.,
    ``V_sorted[(N-1)/2]``, when ``N`` is odd and the average of the two
    middle values of ``V_sorted`` when ``N`` is even.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10.0, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
    >>> a[0, 1] = np.nan
    >>> a
    array([[10., nan,  4.],
           [ 3.,  2.,  1.]])
    >>> np.median(a)
    np.float64(nan)
    >>> np.nanmedian(a)
    3.0
    >>> np.nanmedian(a, axis=0)
    array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
    >>> np.median(a, axis=1)
    array([nan,  2.])
    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanmedian(b, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([7.,  2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)
    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanmedian(b, axis=None, overwrite_input=True)
    3.0
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10.0, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
    >>> a[0, 1] = np.nan
    >>> a
    array([[10., nan,  4.],
           [ 3.,  2.,  1.]])
    >>> np.median(a)
    np.float64(nan)
    >>> np.nanmedian(a)
    3.0
    >>> np.nanmedian(a, axis=0)
    array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
    >>> np.median(a, axis=1)
    array([nan,  2.])
    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanmedian(b, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([7.,  2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)
    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanmedian(b, axis=None, overwrite_input=True)
    3.0
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)

    Using nanmedian with keepdims:
    >>> a = np.array([[10.0, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
    >>> a[0, 1] = np.nan
    >>> np.nanmedian(a, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    array([[6.5],
           [2. ],
           [2.5]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `keepdims` parameter, which is an important feature of the `nanmedian` function. This example shows how to use `keepdims` to preserve the original shape of the input array.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a wide range of use cases, including computing the median along different axes, using `overwrite_input`, and comparing the results with `np.median`. The additional example I added provides further insight into the behavior of `nanmedian` with `keepdims`.
