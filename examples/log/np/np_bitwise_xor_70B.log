I will provide you with the docstring for the bitwise_xor function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.bitwise_xor. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

bitwise_xor(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Compute the bit-wise XOR of two arrays element-wise.

Computes the bit-wise XOR of the underlying binary representation of
the integers in the input arrays. This ufunc implements the C/Python
operator ``^``.

Parameters
----------
x1, x2 : array_like
    Only integer and boolean types are handled.
    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
out : ndarray or scalar
    Result.
    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

See Also
--------
logical_xor
bitwise_and
bitwise_or
binary_repr :
    Return the binary representation of the input number as a string.

Examples
--------
The number 13 is represented by ``00001101``. Likewise, 17 is
represented by ``00010001``.  The bit-wise XOR of 13 and 17 is
therefore ``00011100``, or 28:

>>> np.bitwise_xor(13, 17)
28
>>> np.binary_repr(28)
'11100'

>>> np.bitwise_xor(31, 5)
26
>>> np.bitwise_xor([31,3], 5)
array([26,  6])

>>> np.bitwise_xor([31,3], [5,6])
array([26,  5])
>>> np.bitwise_xor([True, True], [False, True])
array([ True, False])

The ``^`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.bitwise_xor`` on
ndarrays.

>>> x1 = np.array([True, True])
>>> x2 = np.array([False, True])
>>> x1 ^ x2
array([ True, False])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
The number 13 is represented by ``00001101``. Likewise, 17 is
represented by ``00010001``.  The bit-wise XOR of 13 and 17 is
therefore ``00011100``, or 28:

>>> np.bitwise_xor(13, 17)
28
>>> np.binary_repr(28)
'11100'

>>> np.bitwise_xor(31, 5)
26
>>> np.bitwise_xor([31,3], 5)
array([26,  6])

>>> np.bitwise_xor([31,3], [5,6])
array([26,  5])
>>> np.bitwise_xor([True, True], [False, True])
array([ True, False])

The ``^`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.bitwise_xor`` on
ndarrays.

>>> x1 = np.array([True, True])
>>> x2 = np.array([False, True])
>>> x1 ^ x2
array([ True, False])

Bit-wise XOR with out parameter:

>>> out = np.zeros(2, dtype=int)
>>> np.bitwise_xor([31,3], 5, out=out)
>>> out
array([26,  6])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `out` parameter, which is an important feature of the `bitwise_xor` function. This example shows how to use the `out` parameter to store the result in a pre-allocated array.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including scalar inputs, array inputs, and broadcasting. The additional example I added provides further insight into the function's behavior when using the `out` parameter. With these examples, users should have a good understanding of how to use the `bitwise_xor` function in various situations.
