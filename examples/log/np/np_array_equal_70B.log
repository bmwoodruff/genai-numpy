I will provide you with the docstring for the array_equal function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.array_equal. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    True if two arrays have the same shape and elements, False otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a1, a2 : array_like
        Input arrays.
    equal_nan : bool
        Whether to compare NaN's as equal. If the dtype of a1 and a2 is
        complex, values will be considered equal if either the real or the
        imaginary component of a given value is ``nan``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.19.0

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equal.

    See Also
    --------
    allclose: Returns True if two arrays are element-wise equal within a
              tolerance.
    array_equiv: Returns True if input arrays are shape consistent and all
                 elements equal.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.array_equal([1, 2], [1, 2])
    True
    >>> np.array_equal(np.array([1, 2]), np.array([1, 2]))
    True
    >>> np.array_equal([1, 2], [1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> np.array_equal([1, 2], [1, 4])
    False
    >>> a = np.array([1, np.nan])
    >>> np.array_equal(a, a)
    False
    >>> np.array_equal(a, a, equal_nan=True)
    True

    When ``equal_nan`` is True, complex values with nan components are
    considered equal if either the real *or* the imaginary components are nan.

    >>> a = np.array([1 + 1j])
    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> a.real = np.nan
    >>> b.imag = np.nan
    >>> np.array_equal(a, b, equal_nan=True)
    True

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    True if two arrays have the same shape and elements, False otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a1, a2 : array_like
        Input arrays.
    equal_nan : bool
        Whether to compare NaN's as equal. If the dtype of a1 and a2 is
        complex, values will be considered equal if either the real or the
        imaginary component of a given value is ``nan``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.19.0

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        Returns True if the arrays are equal.

    --------
    allclose: Returns True if two arrays are element-wise equal within a
              tolerance.
    array_equiv: Returns True if input arrays are shape consistent and all
                 elements equal.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.array_equal([1, 2], [1, 2])
    True
    >>> np.array_equal(np.array([1, 2]), np.array([1, 2]))

    False
    >>> a = np.array([1, np.nan])
    >>> np.array_equal(a, a)
    False

    True

    When ``equal_nan`` is True, complex values with nan components are
    considered equal if either the real *or* the imaginary components are nan.

    >>> a = np.array([1 + 1j])
    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> a.real = np.nan
    >>> b.imag = np.nan
    >>> np.array_equal(a, b, equal_nan=True)
    True

    >>> np.array_equal(np.array([1, 2]), np.array([1., 2.]))
    False
