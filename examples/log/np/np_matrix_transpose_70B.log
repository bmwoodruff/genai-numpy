I will provide you with the docstring for the matrix_transpose function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.matrix_transpose. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Transposes a matrix (or a stack of matrices) ``x``.

    This function is Array API compatible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array having shape (..., M, N) and whose two innermost
        dimensions form ``MxN`` matrices.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        An array containing the transpose for each matrix and having shape
        (..., N, M).

    See Also
    --------
    transpose : Generic transpose method.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.matrix_transpose([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    array([[1, 3],
           [2, 4]])

    >>> np.matrix_transpose([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
    array([[[1, 3],
            [2, 4]],
           [[5, 7],
            [6, 8]]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Transposes a matrix (or a stack of matrices) ``x``.

    This function is Array API compatible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array having shape (..., M, N) and whose two innermost
        dimensions form ``MxN`` matrices.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        An array containing the transpose for each matrix and having shape
        (..., N, M).

    See Also
    --------
    transpose : Generic transpose method.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.matrix_transpose([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    array([[1, 3],
           [2, 4]])

    >>> np.matrix_transpose([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
    array([[[1, 3],
            [2, 4]],
           [[5, 7],
            [6, 8]]])

    Transposing a 3D array:
    
    >>> x = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[9, 10], [11, 12]]])
    >>> np.matrix_transpose(x)
    array([[[ 1,  3],
            [ 2,  4]],
           [[ 5,  7],
            [ 6,  8]],
           [[ 9, 11],
            [10, 12]]])

I decided to add this example because it shows how the `matrix_transpose` function works with a 3D array, which is a common use case. This example helps to illustrate how the function can be used to transpose matrices in higher-dimensional arrays.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples, along with the new one, provide a good coverage of the function's behavior. The first example shows the basic usage of the function with a 2D array, the second example shows how it works with a 3D array, and the new example provides additional context for the 3D case. Adding more examples would likely be redundant and not provide significant additional value to the user.
