I will provide you with the docstring for the delete function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.delete. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return a new array with sub-arrays along an axis deleted. For a one
    dimensional array, this returns those entries not returned by
    `arr[obj]`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
        Input array.
    obj : slice, int or array of ints
        Indicate indices of sub-arrays to remove along the specified axis.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.19.0
            Boolean indices are now treated as a mask of elements to remove,
            rather than being cast to the integers 0 and 1.

    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to delete the subarray defined by `obj`.
        If `axis` is None, `obj` is applied to the flattened array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        A copy of `arr` with the elements specified by `obj` removed. Note
        that `delete` does not occur in-place. If `axis` is None, `out` is
        a flattened array.

    See Also
    --------
    insert : Insert elements into an array.
    append : Append elements at the end of an array.

    Notes
    -----
    Often it is preferable to use a boolean mask. For example:

    >>> arr = np.arange(12) + 1
    >>> mask = np.ones(len(arr), dtype=bool)
    >>> mask[[0,2,4]] = False
    >>> result = arr[mask,...]

    Is equivalent to ``np.delete(arr, [0,2,4], axis=0)``, but allows further
    use of `mask`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])
    >>> arr
    array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
           [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
           [ 9, 10, 11, 12]])
    >>> np.delete(arr, 1, 0)
    array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
           [ 9, 10, 11, 12]])

    >>> np.delete(arr, np.s_[::2], 1)
    array([[ 2,  4],
           [ 6,  8],
           [10, 12]])
    >>> np.delete(arr, [1,3,5], None)
    array([ 1,  3,  5,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])
    >>> arr
    array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
           [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
           [ 9, 10, 11, 12]])
    >>> np.delete(arr, 1, 0)
    array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
           [ 9, 10, 11, 12]])

    >>> np.delete(arr, np.s_[::2], 1)
    array([[ 2,  4],
           [ 6,  8],
           [10, 12]])
    >>> np.delete(arr, [1,3,5], None)
    array([ 1,  3,  5,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12])

    Deleting a single element:
    
    >>> arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> np.delete(arr, 2)
    array([1, 2, 4, 5])

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only showed deletion of multiple elements or sub-arrays. This new example demonstrates the deletion of a single element, which is a common use case for this function.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including deletion along a specific axis, deletion using a slice object, and deletion from a flattened array. The new example I added provides additional clarity on the function's behavior when deleting a single element.
