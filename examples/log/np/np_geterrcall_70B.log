I will provide you with the docstring for the geterrcall function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.geterrcall. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the current callback function used on floating-point errors.

    When the error handling for a floating-point error (one of "divide",
    "over", "under", or "invalid") is set to 'call' or 'log', the function
    that is called or the log instance that is written to is returned by
    `geterrcall`. This function or log instance has been set with
    `seterrcall`.

    Returns
    -------
    errobj : callable, log instance or None
        The current error handler. If no handler was set through `seterrcall`,
        ``None`` is returned.

    --------
    seterrcall, seterr, geterr

    Notes
    -----
    For complete documentation of the types of floating-point exceptions and
    treatment options, see `seterr`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.geterrcall()  # we did not yet set a handler, returns None

    >>> orig_settings = np.seterr(all='call')
    >>> def err_handler(type, flag):
    ...     print("Floating point error (%s), with flag %s" % (type, flag))
    >>> old_handler = np.seterrcall(err_handler)
    >>> np.array([1, 2, 3]) / 0.0
    Floating point error (divide by zero), with flag 1
    array([inf, inf, inf])

    >>> cur_handler = np.geterrcall()
    >>> cur_handler is err_handler
    True
    >>> old_settings = np.seterr(**orig_settings)  # restore original
    >>> old_handler = np.seterrcall(None)  # restore original

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.geterrcall()  # we did not yet set a handler, returns None

    >>> orig_settings = np.seterr(all='call')
    >>> def err_handler(type, flag):
    ...     print("Floating point error (%s), with flag %s" % (type, flag))
    >>> old_handler = np.seterrcall(err_handler)
    >>> np.array([1, 2, 3]) / 0.0
    Floating point error (divide by zero), with flag 1
    array([inf, inf, inf])

    >>> cur_handler = np.geterrcall()
    >>> cur_handler is err_handler
    True
    >>> old_settings = np.seterr(**orig_settings)  # restore original
    >>> old_handler = np.seterrcall(None)  # restore original

    Restoring original error handler:
    
    >>> np.seterrcall(None)
    >>> np.geterrcall() is None
    True
