I will provide you with the docstring for the meshgrid function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.meshgrid. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return a tuple of coordinate matrices from coordinate vectors.

    Make N-D coordinate arrays for vectorized evaluations of
    N-D scalar/vector fields over N-D grids, given
    one-dimensional coordinate arrays x1, x2,..., xn.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.9
       1-D and 0-D cases are allowed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2,..., xn : array_like
        1-D arrays representing the coordinates of a grid.
    indexing : {'xy', 'ij'}, optional
        Cartesian ('xy', default) or matrix ('ij') indexing of output.
        See Notes for more details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    sparse : bool, optional
        If True the shape of the returned coordinate array for dimension *i*
        is reduced from ``(N1, ..., Ni, ... Nn)`` to
        ``(1, ..., 1, Ni, 1, ..., 1)``.  These sparse coordinate grids are
        intended to be use with :ref:`basics.broadcasting`.  When all
        coordinates are used in an expression, broadcasting still leads to a
        fully-dimensonal result array.

        Default is False.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    copy : bool, optional
        If False, a view into the original arrays are returned in order to
        conserve memory.  Default is True.  Please note that
        ``sparse=False, copy=False`` will likely return non-contiguous
        arrays.  Furthermore, more than one element of a broadcast array
        may refer to a single memory location.  If you need to write to the
        arrays, make copies first.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    X1, X2,..., XN : tuple of ndarrays
        For vectors `x1`, `x2`,..., `xn` with lengths ``Ni=len(xi)``,
        returns ``(N1, N2, N3,..., Nn)`` shaped arrays if indexing='ij'
        or ``(N2, N1, N3,..., Nn)`` shaped arrays if indexing='xy'
        with the elements of `xi` repeated to fill the matrix along
        the first dimension for `x1`, the second for `x2` and so on.

    Notes
    -----
    This function supports both indexing conventions through the indexing
    keyword argument.  Giving the string 'ij' returns a meshgrid with
    matrix indexing, while 'xy' returns a meshgrid with Cartesian indexing.
    In the 2-D case with inputs of length M and N, the outputs are of shape
    (N, M) for 'xy' indexing and (M, N) for 'ij' indexing.  In the 3-D case
    with inputs of length M, N and P, outputs are of shape (N, M, P) for
    'xy' indexing and (M, N, P) for 'ij' indexing.  The difference is
    illustrated by the following code snippet::

        xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing='ij')
        for i in range(nx):
            for j in range(ny):
                # treat xv[i,j], yv[i,j]

        xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing='xy')
        for i in range(nx):
            for j in range(ny):
                # treat xv[j,i], yv[j,i]

    In the 1-D and 0-D case, the indexing and sparse keywords have no effect.

    ogrid : Construct an open multi-dimensional "meshgrid" using indexing
            notation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> nx, ny = (3, 2)
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, nx)
    >>> y = np.linspace(0, 1, ny)
    >>> xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    >>> xv
    array([[0. , 0.5, 1. ],
           [0. , 0.5, 1. ]])
    >>> yv
    array([[0.,  0.,  0.],
           [1.,  1.,  1.]])

    The result of `meshgrid` is a coordinate grid:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(xv, yv, marker='o', color='k', linestyle='none')
    >>> plt.show()

    You can create sparse output arrays to save memory and computation time.

    >>> xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, sparse=True)
    >>> xv
    array([[0. ,  0.5,  1. ]])
    >>> yv
    array([[0.],
           [1.]])

    `meshgrid` is very useful to evaluate functions on a grid. If the
    function depends on all coordinates, both dense and sparse outputs can be
    used.

    >>> x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 101)
    >>> y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 101)
    >>> # full coordinate arrays
    >>> xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    >>> zz = np.sqrt(xx**2 + yy**2)
    >>> xx.shape, yy.shape, zz.shape
    ((101, 101), (101, 101), (101, 101))
    >>> # sparse coordinate arrays
    >>> xs, ys = np.meshgrid(x, y, sparse=True)
    >>> zs = np.sqrt(xs**2 + ys**2)
    >>> xs.shape, ys.shape, zs.shape
    ((1, 101), (101, 1), (101, 101))
    >>> np.array_equal(zz, zs)
    True

    >>> h = plt.contourf(x, y, zs)
    >>> plt.axis('scaled')
    >>> plt.colorbar()
    >>> plt.show()
