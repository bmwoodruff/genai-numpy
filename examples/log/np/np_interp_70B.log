I will provide you with the docstring for the interp function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.interp. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    One-dimensional linear interpolation for monotonically increasing sample points.

    Returns the one-dimensional piecewise linear interpolant to a function
    with given discrete data points (`xp`, `fp`), evaluated at `x`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The x-coordinates at which to evaluate the interpolated values.

    xp : 1-D sequence of floats
        The x-coordinates of the data points, must be increasing if argument
        `period` is not specified. Otherwise, `xp` is internally sorted after
        normalizing the periodic boundaries with ``xp = xp % period``.

    fp : 1-D sequence of float or complex
        The y-coordinates of the data points, same length as `xp`.

    left : optional float or complex corresponding to fp
        Value to return for `x < xp[0]`, default is `fp[0]`.

    right : optional float or complex corresponding to fp
        Value to return for `x > xp[-1]`, default is `fp[-1]`.

    period : None or float, optional
        A period for the x-coordinates. This parameter allows the proper
        interpolation of angular x-coordinates. Parameters `left` and `right`
        are ignored if `period` is specified.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Returns
    -------
    y : float or complex (corresponding to fp) or ndarray
        The interpolated values, same shape as `x`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `xp` and `fp` have different length
        If `xp` or `fp` are not 1-D sequences
        If `period == 0`

    See Also
    --------
    scipy.interpolate

    Warnings
    --------
    The x-coordinate sequence is expected to be increasing, but this is not
    explicitly enforced.  However, if the sequence `xp` is non-increasing,
    interpolation results are meaningless.

    Note that, since NaN is unsortable, `xp` also cannot contain NaNs.

    A simple check for `xp` being strictly increasing is::

        np.all(np.diff(xp) > 0)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> xp = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> fp = [3, 2, 0]
    >>> np.interp(2.5, xp, fp)
    1.0
    >>> np.interp([0, 1, 1.5, 2.72, 3.14], xp, fp)
    array([3.  , 3.  , 2.5 , 0.56, 0.  ])
    >>> UNDEF = -99.0
    >>> np.interp(3.14, xp, fp, right=UNDEF)
    -99.0

    Plot an interpolant to the sine function:

    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 10)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)
    >>> xvals = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 50)
    >>> yinterp = np.interp(xvals, x, y)
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.plot(xvals, yinterp, '-x')
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.show()

    Interpolation with periodic x-coordinates:

    >>> x = [-180, -170, -185, 185, -10, -5, 0, 365]
    >>> xp = [190, -190, 350, -350]
    >>> fp = [5, 10, 3, 4]
    >>> np.interp(x, xp, fp, period=360)
    array([7.5 , 5.  , 8.75, 6.25, 3.  , 3.25, 3.5 , 3.75])

    Complex interpolation:

    >>> x = [1.5, 4.0]
    >>> xp = [2,3,5]
    >>> fp = [1.0j, 0, 2+3j]
    >>> np.interp(x, xp, fp)
    array([0.+1.j , 1.+1.5j])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> xp = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> fp = [3, 2, 0]
    >>> np.interp(2.5, xp, fp)
    1.0
    >>> np.interp([0, 1, 1.5, 2.72, 3.14], xp, fp)
    array([3.  , 3.  , 2.5 , 0.56, 0.  ])
    >>> UNDEF = -99.0
    >>> np.interp(3.14, xp, fp, right=UNDEF)
    -99.0

    Plot an interpolant to the sine function:

    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 10)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)
    >>> xvals = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 50)
    >>> yinterp = np.interp(xvals, x, y)
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.plot(xvals, yinterp, '-x')
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.show()

    Interpolation with periodic x-coordinates:

    >>> x = [-180, -170, -185, 185, -10, -5, 0, 365]
    >>> xp = [190, -190, 350, -350]
    >>> fp = [5, 10, 3, 4]
    >>> np.interp(x, xp, fp, period=360)
    array([7.5 , 5.  , 8.75, 6.25, 3.  , 3.25, 3.5 , 3.75])

    Complex interpolation:

    >>> x = [1.5, 4.0]
    >>> xp = [2,3,5]
    >>> fp = [1.0j, 0, 2+3j]
    >>> np.interp(x, xp, fp)
    array([0.+1.j , 1.+1.5j])

    Interpolation with left and right values:

    >>> xp = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> fp = [3, 2, 0]
    >>> left = 10
    >>> right = 20
    >>> np.interp([-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], xp, fp, left, right)
    array([10., 10.,  3.,  2.,  0., 20.])

I added an example to demonstrate the use of `left` and `right` parameters, which allows users to specify custom values for interpolation outside of the `xp` range. This example helps to clarify the behavior of `interp` when dealing with out-of-bounds values.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a wide range of use cases, including simple interpolation, interpolation with periodic x-coordinates, and complex interpolation. The additional example I provided helps to fill a gap in the documentation by demonstrating the use of `left` and `right` parameters.
