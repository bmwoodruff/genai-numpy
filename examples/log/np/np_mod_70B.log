I will provide you with the docstring for the mod function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.mod. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

remainder(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Returns the element-wise remainder of division.

Computes the remainder complementary to the `floor_divide` function.  It is
equivalent to the Python modulus operator ``x1 % x2`` and has the same sign
as the divisor `x2`. The MATLAB function equivalent to ``np.remainder``
is ``mod``.

.. warning::

    This should not be confused with:

    * Python 3.7's `math.remainder` and C's ``remainder``, which
      computes the IEEE remainder, which are the complement to
      ``round(x1 / x2)``.
    * The MATLAB ``rem`` function and or the C ``%`` operator which is the
      complement to ``int(x1 / x2)``.

Parameters
----------
x1 : array_like
    Dividend array.
x2 : array_like
    Divisor array.
    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray
    The element-wise remainder of the quotient ``floor_divide(x1, x2)``.
    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

See Also
--------
floor_divide : Equivalent of Python ``//`` operator.
divmod : Simultaneous floor division and remainder.
fmod : Equivalent of the MATLAB ``rem`` function.
divide, floor

Notes
-----
Returns 0 when `x2` is 0 and both `x1` and `x2` are (arrays of)
integers.
``mod`` is an alias of ``remainder``.

Examples
--------
>>> np.remainder([4, 7], [2, 3])
array([0, 1])
>>> np.remainder(np.arange(7), 5)
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1])

The ``%`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.remainder`` on
ndarrays.

>>> x1 = np.arange(7)
>>> x1 % 5
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.remainder([4, 7], [2, 3])
array([0, 1])
>>> np.remainder(np.arange(7), 5)
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1])

The ``%`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.remainder`` on
ndarrays.

>>> x1 = np.arange(7)
>>> x1 % 5
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1])

Float dividend and divisor:
>>> np.remainder([4.0, 7.0], [2.0, 3.0])
array([ 0.,  1.])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the behavior of `np.mod` when the dividend and divisor are floating-point numbers. This is an important use case that was not previously covered in the examples.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.mod` with integer arrays, and the new example I added covers the case with floating-point numbers. The existing examples also demonstrate the use of the `%` operator as a shorthand for `np.remainder`, which is an important aspect of the function's behavior.
