I will provide you with the docstring for the angle function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.angle. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the angle of the complex argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z : array_like
        A complex number or sequence of complex numbers.
    deg : bool, optional
        Return angle in degrees if True, radians if False (default).

    Returns
    -------
    angle : ndarray or scalar
        The counterclockwise angle from the positive real axis on the complex
        plane in the range ``(-pi, pi]``, with dtype as numpy.float64.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.16.0
            This function works on subclasses of ndarray like `ma.array`.

    See Also
    --------
    arctan2
    absolute

    Notes
    -----
    This function passes the imaginary and real parts of the argument to
    `arctan2` to compute the result; consequently, it follows the convention
    of `arctan2` when the magnitude of the argument is zero. See example.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.angle([1.0, 1.0j, 1+1j])               # in radians
    array([ 0.        ,  1.57079633,  0.78539816]) # may vary
    >>> np.angle(1+1j, deg=True)                  # in degrees
    45.0
    >>> np.angle([0., -0., complex(0., -0.), complex(-0., -0.)])  # convention
    array([ 0.        ,  3.14159265, -0.        , -3.14159265])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.angle([1.0, 1.0j, 1+1j])               # in radians
    array([ 0.        ,  1.57079633,  0.78539816]) # may vary
    >>> np.angle(1+1j, deg=True)                  # in degrees
    45.0
    >>> np.angle([0., -0., complex(0., -0.), complex(-0., -0.)])  # convention
    array([ 0.        ,  3.14159265, -0.        , -3.14159265])
    Angle of a complex number with zero real part:
    >>> np.angle(1j)
    1.5707963267948966
