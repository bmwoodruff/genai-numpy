I will provide you with the docstring for the polyval function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polyval. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Evaluate a polynomial at specific values.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    If `p` is of length N, this function returns the value::

        p[0]*x**(N-1) + p[1]*x**(N-2) + ... + p[N-2]*x + p[N-1]

    If `x` is a sequence, then ``p(x)`` is returned for each element of ``x``.
    If `x` is another polynomial then the composite polynomial ``p(x(t))``
    is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : array_like or poly1d object
       1D array of polynomial coefficients (including coefficients equal
       to zero) from highest degree to the constant term, or an
       instance of poly1d.
    x : array_like or poly1d object
       A number, an array of numbers, or an instance of poly1d, at
       which to evaluate `p`.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray or poly1d
       If `x` is a poly1d instance, the result is the composition of the two
       polynomials, i.e., `x` is "substituted" in `p` and the simplified
       result is returned. In addition, the type of `x` - array_like or
       poly1d - governs the type of the output: `x` array_like => `values`
       array_like, `x` a poly1d object => `values` is also.

    See Also
    --------
    poly1d: A polynomial class.

    Notes
    -----
    Horner's scheme [1]_ is used to evaluate the polynomial. Even so,
    for polynomials of high degree the values may be inaccurate due to
    rounding errors. Use carefully.

    If `x` is a subtype of `ndarray` the return value will be of the same type.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.polyval([3,0,1], 5)  # 3 * 5**2 + 0 * 5**1 + 1
    76
    >>> np.polyval([3,0,1], np.poly1d(5))
    poly1d([76])
    >>> np.polyval(np.poly1d([3,0,1]), 5)
    76
    >>> np.polyval(np.poly1d([3,0,1]), np.poly1d(5))
    poly1d([76])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.polyval([3,0,1], 5)  # 3 * 5**2 + 0 * 5**1 + 1
    76
    >>> np.polyval([3,0,1], np.poly1d(5))
    poly1d([76])
    >>> np.polyval(np.poly1d([3,0,1]), 5)
    76
    >>> np.polyval(np.poly1d([3,0,1]), np.poly1d(5))
    poly1d([76])
    Evaluating a polynomial at multiple values:
    
    >>> p = [3, 0, 1]
    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> np.polyval(p, x)
    [ 4  7 12 19 76]

I decided to add an example to show how `np.polyval` can be used to evaluate a polynomial at multiple values. This is a common use case for this function, and the existing examples do not demonstrate this. The example shows how to pass an array of values to `np.polyval` and how it returns an array of results.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of `np.polyval`, including evaluating a polynomial at a single value, evaluating a polynomial at another polynomial, and evaluating a polynomial defined by a `poly1d` object. The additional example I added covers the case of evaluating a polynomial at multiple values, which is a common use case.
