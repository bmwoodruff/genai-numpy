I will provide you with the docstring for the extract function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.extract. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the elements of an array that satisfy some condition.

    This is equivalent to ``np.compress(ravel(condition), ravel(arr))``.  If
    `condition` is boolean ``np.extract`` is equivalent to ``arr[condition]``.

    Note that `place` does the exact opposite of `extract`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    condition : array_like
        An array whose nonzero or True entries indicate the elements of `arr`
        to extract.
    arr : array_like
        Input array of the same size as `condition`.

    Returns
    -------
    extract : ndarray
        Rank 1 array of values from `arr` where `condition` is True.

    See Also
    --------
    take, put, copyto, compress, place

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = np.arange(12).reshape((3, 4))
    >>> arr
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
    >>> condition = np.mod(arr, 3)==0
    >>> condition
    array([[ True, False, False,  True],
           [False, False,  True, False],
           [False,  True, False, False]])
    >>> np.extract(condition, arr)
    array([0, 3, 6, 9])


    If `condition` is boolean:

    >>> arr[condition]
    array([0, 3, 6, 9])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = np.arange(12).reshape((3, 4))
    >>> arr
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
    >>> condition = np.mod(arr, 3)==0
    >>> condition
    array([[ True, False, False,  True],
           [False, False,  True, False],
           [False,  True, False, False]])
    >>> np.extract(condition, arr)
    array([0, 3, 6, 9])


    If `condition` is boolean:

    >>> arr[condition]
    array([0, 3, 6, 9])

    Using np.extract with a 1D array:

    >>> arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> condition = arr % 2 == 0
    >>> np.extract(condition, arr)
    array([2, 4, 6])


I decided to add an example to show how `np.extract` works with a 1D array, as the existing examples only demonstrate its use with a 2D array. This additional example helps to illustrate the function's behavior in a different context.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already provide a good understanding of how `np.extract` works, and the additional example I added covers a different use case. Further examples may not add significant value to the documentation.
