I will provide you with the docstring for the nanprod function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nanprod. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the product of array elements over a given axis treating Not a
    Numbers (NaNs) as ones.

    One is returned for slices that are all-NaN or empty.

    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose product is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the product is computed. The default is to compute
        the product of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  By default, the dtype of `a` is used.  An
        exception is when `a` has an integer type with less precision than
        the platform (u)intp. In that case, the default will be either
        (u)int32 or (u)int64 depending on whether the platform is 32 or 64
        bits. For inexact inputs, dtype must be inexact.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``. If provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary. See
        :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details. The casting of NaN to integer
        can yield unexpected results.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
        dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will
        broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.
    initial : scalar, optional
        The starting value for this product. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the product. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    nanprod : ndarray
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case it is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.prod : Product across array propagating NaNs.
    isnan : Show which elements are NaN.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.nanprod(1)
    1
    >>> np.nanprod([1])
    1
    >>> np.nanprod([1, np.nan])
    1.0
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanprod(a)
    6.0
    >>> np.nanprod(a, axis=0)
    array([3., 2.])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.nanprod(1)
    1
    >>> np.nanprod([1])
    1
    >>> np.nanprod([1, np.nan])
    1.0
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanprod(a)
    6.0
    >>> np.nanprod(a, axis=0)
    array([3., 2.])
    Using nanprod with all-NaN slices:
    
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [np.nan, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanprod(a, axis=0)
    array([1., 1.])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the behavior of `np.nanprod` when dealing with all-NaN slices. This is an important edge case that users should be aware of, and the existing examples did not cover it.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a good range of use cases, including scalar input, 1D array input, and 2D array input with and without NaNs. The additional example I added fills a gap in the existing examples, and further examples would likely be redundant or cover very specific edge cases that are not crucial to understanding the function's behavior.
