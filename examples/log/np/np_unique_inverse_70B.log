I will provide you with the docstring for the unique_inverse function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.unique_inverse. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Find the unique elements of `x` and indices to reconstruct `x`.

    This function is Array API compatible alternative to:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 1, 2])
    >>> np.unique(x, return_inverse=True, equal_nan=False)
    (array([1, 2]), array([0, 0, 1]))

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array. It will be flattened if it is not already 1-D.

    Returns
    -------
    out : namedtuple
        The result containing:

        * values - The unique elements of an input array.
        * inverse_indices - The indices from the set of unique elements
          that reconstruct `x`.

    See Also
    --------
    unique : Find the unique elements of an array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.unique_inverse([1, 1, 2])
    UniqueInverseResult(values=array([1, 2]), inverse_indices=array([0, 0, 1]))

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.unique_inverse([1, 1, 2])
    UniqueInverseResult(values=array([1, 2]), inverse_indices=array([0, 0, 1]))

    Reconstructing the original array:
    
    >>> result = np.unique_inverse([1, 1, 2])
    >>> result.values[result.inverse_indices]
    array([1, 1, 2])

I decided to add this example because it shows how to use the `inverse_indices` returned by `np.unique_inverse` to reconstruct the original array. This is an important use case for this function, and the example helps to illustrate how to do it.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic usage of `np.unique_inverse`, and the new example I added shows how to use the result to reconstruct the original array. These two examples together provide a good understanding of how to use `np.unique_inverse`.
