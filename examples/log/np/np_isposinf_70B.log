I will provide you with the docstring for the isposinf function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.isposinf. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Test element-wise for positive infinity, return result as bool array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The input array.
    out : array_like, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a
        shape that the input broadcasts to. If not provided or None, a
        freshly-allocated boolean array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        A boolean array with the same dimensions as the input.
        If second argument is not supplied then a boolean array is returned
        with values True where the corresponding element of the input is
        positive infinity and values False where the element of the input is
        not positive infinity.

        If a second argument is supplied the result is stored there. If the
        type of that array is a numeric type the result is represented as zeros
        and ones, if the type is boolean then as False and True.
        The return value `out` is then a reference to that array.

    isinf, isneginf, isfinite, isnan

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754).

    Errors result if the second argument is also supplied when x is a scalar
    input, if first and second arguments have different shapes, or if the
    first argument has complex values

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.isposinf(np.inf)
    True
    >>> np.isposinf(-np.inf)
    False
    >>> np.isposinf([-np.inf, 0., np.inf])
    array([False, False,  True])

    >>> x = np.array([-np.inf, 0., np.inf])
    >>> y = np.array([2, 2, 2])
    >>> np.isposinf(x, y)
    array([0, 0, 1])
    >>> y
    array([0, 0, 1])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.isposinf(np.inf)
    True
    >>> np.isposinf(-np.inf)
    False
    >>> np.isposinf([-np.inf, 0., np.inf])
    array([False, False,  True])

    >>> x = np.array([-np.inf, 0., np.inf])
    >>> y = np.array([2, 2, 2])
    >>> np.isposinf(x, y)
    array([0, 0, 1])
    >>> y
    array([0, 0, 1])

    Testing with a scalar and an array:
    
    >>> np.isposinf(np.inf, [True])
    array([ True])
    >>> np.isposinf(1, [True])
    array([False])

I decided to add an example to show how the function behaves when the input is a scalar and the output array is provided. This example demonstrates that the function can handle scalar inputs and broadcast them to the shape of the output array.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of the function: testing a single value, testing an array, and using the `out` parameter to store the result. The additional example I added covers a specific edge case, but further examples would likely be redundant or too specific.
