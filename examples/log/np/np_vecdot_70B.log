You are a helpful assistant working to improve the NumPy documentation. Use numpydoc style guidelines.

I will provide you with the docstring for the vecdot function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.vecdot. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

vecdot(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, axes, axis])

Vector dot product of two arrays.

Let :math:`\mathbf{a}` be a vector in `x1` and :math:`\mathbf{b}` be
a corresponding vector in `x2`. The dot product is defined as:

.. math::
   \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \overline{a_i}b_i

where the sum is over the last dimension (unless `axis` is specified) and
where :math:`\overline{a_i}` denotes the complex conjugate if :math:`a_i`
is complex and the identity otherwise.

Parameters
----------
x1, x2 : array_like
    Input arrays, scalars not allowed.
out : ndarray, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the broadcasted shape of `x1` and `x2` with the last axis
    removed. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated array is used.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray
    The vector dot product of the inputs.
    This is a scalar only when both x1, x2 are 1-d vectors.

Raises
------
ValueError
    If the last dimension of `x1` is not the same size as
    the last dimension of `x2`.

    If a scalar value is passed in.

See Also
--------
vdot : same but flattens arguments first
einsum : Einstein summation convention.

Examples
--------
Get the projected size along a given normal for an array of vectors.

>>> v = np.array([[0., 5., 0.], [0., 0., 10.], [0., 6., 8.]])
>>> n = np.array([0., 0.6, 0.8])
>>> np.vecdot(v, n)
array([ 3.,  8., 10.])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

Examples
--------
Get the projected size along a given normal for an array of vectors.

>>> v = np.array([[0., 5., 0.], [0., 0., 10.], [0., 6., 8.]])
>>> n = np.array([0., 0.6, 0.8])
>>> np.vecdot(v, n)
array([ 3.,  8., 10.])

Dot product of two complex vectors.

>>> a = np.array([1 + 2j, 3 + 4j])
>>> b = np.array([5 + 6j, 7 + 8j])
>>> np.vecdot(a, b)
(70+102j)
