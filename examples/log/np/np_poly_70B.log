I will provide you with the docstring for the poly function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.poly. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Find the coefficients of a polynomial with the given sequence of roots.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    Returns the coefficients of the polynomial whose leading coefficient
    is one for the given sequence of zeros (multiple roots must be included
    in the sequence as many times as their multiplicity; see Examples).
    A square matrix (or array, which will be treated as a matrix) can also
    be given, in which case the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial
    of the matrix are returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq_of_zeros : array_like, shape (N,) or (N, N)
        A sequence of polynomial roots, or a square array or matrix object.

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        1D array of polynomial coefficients from highest to lowest degree:

        ``c[0] * x**(N) + c[1] * x**(N-1) + ... + c[N-1] * x + c[N]``
        where c[0] always equals 1.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If input is the wrong shape (the input must be a 1-D or square
        2-D array).

    See Also
    --------
    polyval : Compute polynomial values.
    roots : Return the roots of a polynomial.
    polyfit : Least squares polynomial fit.
    poly1d : A one-dimensional polynomial class.

    Notes
    -----
    Specifying the roots of a polynomial still leaves one degree of
    freedom, typically represented by an undetermined leading
    coefficient. [1]_ In the case of this function, that coefficient -
    the first one in the returned array - is always taken as one. (If
    for some reason you have one other point, the only automatic way
    presently to leverage that information is to use ``polyfit``.)

    The characteristic polynomial, :math:`p_a(t)`, of an `n`-by-`n`
    matrix **A** is given by

    :math:`p_a(t) = \mathrm{det}(t\, \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})`,

    where **I** is the `n`-by-`n` identity matrix. [2]_

    Examples
    --------
    Given a sequence of a polynomial's zeros:

    >>> np.poly((0, 0, 0)) # Multiple root example
    array([1., 0., 0., 0.])

    The line above represents z**3 + 0*z**2 + 0*z + 0.

    >>> np.poly((-1./2, 0, 1./2))
    array([ 1.  ,  0.  , -0.25,  0.  ])

    The line above represents z**3 - z/4

    >>> np.poly((np.random.random(1)[0], 0, np.random.random(1)[0]))
    array([ 1.        , -0.77086955,  0.08618131,  0.        ]) # random

    Given a square array object:

    >>> P = np.array([[0, 1./3], [-1./2, 0]])
    >>> np.poly(P)
    array([1.        , 0.        , 0.16666667])

    Note how in all cases the leading coefficient is always 1.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    Given a sequence of a polynomial's zeros:

    >>> np.poly((0, 0, 0)) # Multiple root example
    array([1., 0., 0., 0.])

    The line above represents z**3 + 0*z**2 + 0*z + 0.

    >>> np.poly((-1./2, 0, 1./2))
    array([ 1.  ,  0.  , -0.25,  0.  ])

    The line above represents z**3 - z/4

    >>> np.poly((np.random.random(1)[0], 0, np.random.random(1)[0]))
    array([ 1.        , -0.77086955,  0.08618131,  0.        ]) # random

    Given a square array object:

    >>> P = np.array([[0, 1./3], [-1./2, 0]])
    >>> np.poly(P)
    array([1.        , 0.        , 0.16666667])

    Note how in all cases the leading coefficient is always 1.

    Complex roots example:
    
    >>> np.poly((1 + 1j, 1 - 1j, -1))
    array([1. +0.j, -1.+0.j,  1.+0.j,  1.+0.j])

I decided to add an example that demonstrates the use of complex roots, as the existing examples only show real roots. This example helps to illustrate the function's behavior when dealing with complex roots, which is an important aspect of polynomial algebra.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including multiple roots, real roots, and square array objects. The additional example I provided helps to fill a gap in the documentation by showing how the function handles complex roots.
