I will provide you with the docstring for the dot function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.dot. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    dot(a, b, out=None)

    Dot product of two arrays. Specifically,

    - If both `a` and `b` are 1-D arrays, it is inner product of vectors
      (without complex conjugation).

    - If both `a` and `b` are 2-D arrays, it is matrix multiplication,
      but using :func:`matmul` or ``a @ b`` is preferred.

    - If either `a` or `b` is 0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to
      :func:`multiply` and using ``numpy.multiply(a, b)`` or ``a * b`` is
      preferred.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over
      the last axis of `a` and `b`.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is an M-D array (where ``M>=2``), it is a
      sum product over the last axis of `a` and the second-to-last axis of
      `b`::

        dot(a, b)[i,j,k,m] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[k,:,m])

    It uses an optimized BLAS library when possible (see `numpy.linalg`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        First argument.
    b : array_like
        Second argument.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
        if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
        C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
        for `dot(a,b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
        conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
        to be flexible.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are both
        scalars or both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned; otherwise
        an array is returned.
        If `out` is given, then it is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the last dimension of `a` is not the same size as
        the second-to-last dimension of `b`.

    See Also
    --------
    vdot : Complex-conjugating dot product.
    tensordot : Sum products over arbitrary axes.
    einsum : Einstein summation convention.
    matmul : '@' operator as method with out parameter.
    linalg.multi_dot : Chained dot product.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.dot(3, 4)
    12

    Neither argument is complex-conjugated:

    >>> np.dot([2j, 3j], [2j, 3j])
    (-13+0j)

    For 2-D arrays it is the matrix product:

    >>> a = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
    >>> b = [[4, 1], [2, 2]]
    >>> np.dot(a, b)
    array([[4, 1],
           [2, 2]])

    >>> a = np.arange(3*4*5*6).reshape((3,4,5,6))
    >>> b = np.arange(3*4*5*6)[::-1].reshape((5,4,6,3))
    >>> np.dot(a, b)[2,3,2,1,2,2]
    499128
    >>> sum(a[2,3,2,:] * b[1,2,:,2])
    499128

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.dot(3, 4)
    12

    Neither argument is complex-conjugated:

    >>> np.dot([2j, 3j], [2j, 3j])
    (-13+0j)

    For 2-D arrays it is the matrix product:

    >>> a = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
    >>> b = [[4, 1], [2, 2]]
    >>> np.dot(a, b)
    array([[4, 1],
           [2, 2]])

    >>> a = np.arange(3*4*5*6).reshape((3,4,5,6))
    >>> b = np.arange(3*4*5*6)[::-1].reshape((5,4,6,3))
    >>> np.dot(a, b)[2,3,2,1,2,2]
    499128
    >>> sum(a[2,3,2,:] * b[1,2,:,2])
    499128

    Dot product of 1-D arrays:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.dot(a, b)
