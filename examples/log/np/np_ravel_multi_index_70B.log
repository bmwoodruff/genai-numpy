I will provide you with the docstring for the ravel_multi_index function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ravel_multi_index. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    ravel_multi_index(multi_index, dims, mode='raise', order='C')

    Converts a tuple of index arrays into an array of flat
    indices, applying boundary modes to the multi-index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    multi_index : tuple of array_like
        A tuple of integer arrays, one array for each dimension.
    dims : tuple of ints
        The shape of array into which the indices from ``multi_index`` apply.
    mode : {'raise', 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
        Specifies how out-of-bounds indices are handled.  Can specify
        either one mode or a tuple of modes, one mode per index.

        * 'raise' -- raise an error (default)
        * 'wrap' -- wrap around
        * 'clip' -- clip to the range

        In 'clip' mode, a negative index which would normally
        wrap will clip to 0 instead.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Determines whether the multi-index should be viewed as
        indexing in row-major (C-style) or column-major
        (Fortran-style) order.

    Returns
    -------
    raveled_indices : ndarray
        An array of indices into the flattened version of an array
        of dimensions ``dims``.

    See Also
    --------
    unravel_index

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arr = np.array([[3,6,6],[4,5,1]])
    >>> np.ravel_multi_index(arr, (7,6))
    array([22, 41, 37])
    >>> np.ravel_multi_index(arr, (7,6), order='F')
    array([31, 41, 13])
    >>> np.ravel_multi_index(arr, (4,6), mode='clip')
    array([22, 23, 19])
    >>> np.ravel_multi_index(arr, (4,4), mode=('clip','wrap'))
    array([12, 13, 13])

    >>> np.ravel_multi_index((3,1,4,1), (6,7,8,9))

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    ravel_multi_index(multi_index, dims, mode='raise', order='C')

    Converts a tuple of index arrays into an array of flat
    indices, applying boundary modes to the multi-index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    multi_index : tuple of array_like
        A tuple of integer arrays, one array for each dimension.
    dims : tuple of ints
        The shape of array into which the indices from ``multi_index`` apply.
    mode : {'raise', 'wrap', 'clip'}, optional
        Specifies how out-of-bounds indices are handled.  Can specify
        either one mode or a tuple of modes, one mode per index.

        * 'raise' -- raise an error (default)
        * 'wrap' -- wrap around
        * 'clip' -- clip to the range

        In 'clip' mode, a negative index which would normally
        wrap will clip to 0 instead.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Determines whether the multi-index should be viewed as
        indexing in row-major (C-style) or column-major
        (Fortran-style) order.

    Returns
    -------
    raveled_indices : ndarray
        An array of indices into the flattened version of an array
        of dimensions ``dims``.

    array([12, 13, 13])

    >>> np.ravel_multi_index((3,1,4,1), (6,7,8,9))
