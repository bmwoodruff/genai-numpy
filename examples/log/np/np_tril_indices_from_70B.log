I will provide you with the docstring for the tril_indices_from function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.tril_indices_from. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the indices for the lower-triangle of arr.

    See `tril_indices` for full details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
        The indices will be valid for square arrays whose dimensions are
        the same as arr.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal offset (see `tril` for details).

    Examples
    --------

    Create a 4 by 4 array.

    >>> a = np.arange(16).reshape(4, 4)
    >>> a
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
           [12, 13, 14, 15]])

    Pass the array to get the indices of the lower triangular elements.

    >>> trili = np.tril_indices_from(a)
    >>> trili
    (array([0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]), array([0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]))

    >>> a[trili]
    array([ 0,  4,  5,  8,  9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15])

    This is syntactic sugar for tril_indices().

    >>> np.tril_indices(a.shape[0])
    (array([0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]), array([0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]))

    Use the `k` parameter to return the indices for the lower triangular array
    up to the k-th diagonal.

    >>> trili1 = np.tril_indices_from(a, k=1)
    >>> a[trili1]
    array([ 0,  1,  4,  5,  6,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return the indices for the lower-triangle of arr.

    See `tril_indices` for full details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
        The indices will be valid for square arrays whose dimensions are
        the same as arr.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal offset (see `tril` for details).

    Examples
    --------

    Create a 4 by 4 array.

    >>> a = np.arange(16).reshape(4, 4)
    >>> a
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
           [12, 13, 14, 15]])

    Pass the array to get the indices of the lower triangular elements.

    >>> trili = np.tril_indices_from(a)
    >>> trili
    (array([0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]), array([0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]))

    >>> a[trili]
    array([ 0,  4,  5,  8,  9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15])

    This is syntactic sugar for tril_indices().

    >>> np.tril_indices(a.shape[0])
    (array([0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]), array([0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]))

    Use the `k` parameter to return the indices for the lower triangular array
    up to the k-th diagonal.

    >>> trili1 = np.tril_indices_from(a, k=1)
    >>> a[trili1]
    array([ 0,  1,  4,  5,  6,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15])

    Using a 3x3 array.

    >>> b = np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> b
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])

    >>> trilb = np.tril_indices_from(b)
    >>> b[trilb]
    array([0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8])

I decided to add an example that uses a 3x3 array to demonstrate the function's behavior with smaller arrays. This example shows that the function works correctly even with smaller arrays, which can help users understand its behavior in different scenarios.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of the function, including using it with a 4x4 array, using the `k` parameter, and comparing it to `tril_indices`. The additional example I added provides further clarification, but it's not necessary to add more examples at this point.
