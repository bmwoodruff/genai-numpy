I will provide you with the docstring for the diag function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.diag. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Extract a diagonal or construct a diagonal array.

    See the more detailed documentation for ``numpy.diagonal`` if you use this
    function to extract a diagonal and wish to write to the resulting array;
    whether it returns a copy or a view depends on what version of numpy you
    are using.

    Parameters
    ----------
    v : array_like
        If `v` is a 2-D array, return a copy of its `k`-th diagonal.
        If `v` is a 1-D array, return a 2-D array with `v` on the `k`-th
        diagonal.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal in question. The default is 0. Use `k>0` for diagonals
        above the main diagonal, and `k<0` for diagonals below the main
        diagonal.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The extracted diagonal or constructed diagonal array.

    See Also
    --------
    diagonal : Return specified diagonals.
    diagflat : Create a 2-D array with the flattened input as a diagonal.
    trace : Sum along diagonals.
    triu : Upper triangle of an array.
    tril : Lower triangle of an array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(9).reshape((3,3))
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])

    >>> np.diag(x)
    array([0, 4, 8])
    >>> np.diag(x, k=1)
    array([1, 5])
    >>> np.diag(x, k=-1)
    array([3, 7])

    >>> np.diag(np.diag(x))
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 8]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Extract a diagonal or construct a diagonal array.

    See the more detailed documentation for ``numpy.diagonal`` if you use this
    function to extract a diagonal and wish to write to the resulting array;
    whether it returns a copy or a view depends on what version of numpy you
    are using.

    Parameters
    ----------
    v : array_like
        If `v` is a 2-D array, return a copy of its `k`-th diagonal.
        If `v` is a 1-D array, return a 2-D array with `v` on the `k`-th
        diagonal.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal in question. The default is 0. Use `k>0` for diagonals
        above the main diagonal, and `k<0` for diagonals below the main
        diagonal.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The extracted diagonal or constructed diagonal array.

    See Also
    --------
    diagonal : Return specified diagonals.
    diagflat : Create a 2-D array with the flattened input as a diagonal.
    trace : Sum along diagonals.
    triu : Upper triangle of an array.
    tril : Lower triangle of an array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(9).reshape((3,3))
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])

    >>> np.diag(x)
    array([0, 4, 8])
    >>> np.diag(x, k=1)
    array([1, 5])
    >>> np.diag(x, k=-1)
    array([3, 7])

    >>> np.diag(np.diag(x))
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 8]])

    Creating a diagonal array from a 1-D array:
    
    >>> np.diag([1, 2, 3])
    array([[1, 0, 0],
           [0, 2, 0],
           [0, 0, 3]])

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only show how to extract diagonals from a 2-D array, but the `diag` function can also be used to construct a diagonal array from a 1-D array. This example demonstrates this usage.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of the `diag` function, and the additional example I added provides a clear illustration of the function's behavior when given a 1-D array.
