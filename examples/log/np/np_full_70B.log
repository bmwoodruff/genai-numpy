I will provide you with the docstring for the full function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.full. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return a new array of given shape and type, filled with `fill_value`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : int or sequence of ints
        Shape of the new array, e.g., ``(2, 3)`` or ``2``.
    fill_value : scalar or array_like
        Fill value.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type for the array  The default, None, means
         ``np.array(fill_value).dtype``.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
        Whether to store multidimensional data in C- or Fortran-contiguous
        (row- or column-wise) order in memory.
    device : str, optional
        The device on which to place the created array. Default: None.
        For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``"cpu"`` if passed.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of `fill_value` with the given shape, dtype, and order.

    See Also
    --------
    full_like : Return a new array with shape of input filled with value.
    empty : Return a new uninitialized array.
    ones : Return a new array setting values to one.
    zeros : Return a new array setting values to zero.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.full((2, 2), np.inf)
    array([[inf, inf],
           [inf, inf]])
    >>> np.full((2, 2), 10)
    array([[10, 10],
           [10, 10]])

    >>> np.full((2, 2), [1, 2])
    array([[1, 2],
           [1, 2]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.full((2, 2), np.inf)
    array([[inf, inf],
           [inf, inf]])
    >>> np.full((2, 2), 10)
    array([[10, 10],
           [10, 10]])

    >>> np.full((2, 2), [1, 2])
    array([[1, 2],
           [1, 2]])

    Different data type:
    >>> np.full((2, 2), 10, dtype=np.complex128)
    array([[10.+0.j, 10.+0.j],
           [10.+0.j, 10.+0.j]])
