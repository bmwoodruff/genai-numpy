I will provide you with the docstring for the minimum function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.minimum. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

minimum(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Element-wise minimum of array elements.

Compare two arrays and return a new array containing the element-wise
minima. If one of the elements being compared is a NaN, then that
element is returned. If both elements are NaNs then the first is
returned. The latter distinction is important for complex NaNs, which
are defined as at least one of the real or imaginary parts being a NaN.
The net effect is that NaNs are propagated.

Parameters
----------
x1, x2 : array_like
    The arrays holding the elements to be compared.
    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray or scalar
    The minimum of `x1` and `x2`, element-wise.
    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

See Also
--------
maximum :
    Element-wise maximum of two arrays, propagates NaNs.
fmin :
    Element-wise minimum of two arrays, ignores NaNs.
amin :
    The minimum value of an array along a given axis, propagates NaNs.
nanmin :
    The minimum value of an array along a given axis, ignores NaNs.

fmax, amax, nanmax

Notes
-----
The minimum is equivalent to ``np.where(x1 <= x2, x1, x2)`` when
neither x1 nor x2 are NaNs, but it is faster and does proper
broadcasting.

Examples
--------
>>> np.minimum([2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 2])
array([1, 3, 2])

>>> np.minimum(np.eye(2), [0.5, 2]) # broadcasting
array([[ 0.5,  0. ],
       [ 0. ,  1. ]])

>>> np.minimum([np.nan, 0, np.nan],[0, np.nan, np.nan])
array([nan, nan, nan])
>>> np.minimum(-np.inf, 1)
-inf

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.minimum([2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 2])
array([1, 3, 2])

>>> np.minimum(np.eye(2), [0.5, 2]) # broadcasting
array([[ 0.5,  0. ],
       [ 0. ,  1. ]])

>>> np.minimum([np.nan, 0, np.nan],[0, np.nan, np.nan])
array([nan, nan, nan])

>>> np.minimum(-np.inf, 1)
-inf

Minimum of complex numbers:
 
>>> np.minimum([1 + 2j, 3 + 4j, 5 + 6j], [2 + 3j, 1 + 2j, 6 + 7j])
array([1.+2.j, 1.+2.j, 5.+6.j])

I decided to add the last example because the existing examples did not cover the case of complex numbers. This example shows how the `np.minimum` function works with complex numbers, which is an important use case.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples, along with the new one, cover a good range of scenarios, including basic element-wise minimum, broadcasting, NaNs, and complex numbers. Adding more examples would likely be redundant and make the documentation harder to read.
