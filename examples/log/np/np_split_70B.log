I will provide you with the docstring for the split function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.split. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Split an array into multiple sub-arrays as views into `ary`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ary : ndarray
        Array to be divided into sub-arrays.
    indices_or_sections : int or 1-D array
        If `indices_or_sections` is an integer, N, the array will be divided
        into N equal arrays along `axis`.  If such a split is not possible,
        an error is raised.

        If `indices_or_sections` is a 1-D array of sorted integers, the entries
        indicate where along `axis` the array is split.  For example,
        ``[2, 3]`` would, for ``axis=0``, result in

        - ary[:2]
        - ary[2:3]
        - ary[3:]

        If an index exceeds the dimension of the array along `axis`,
        an empty sub-array is returned correspondingly.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to split, default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    sub-arrays : list of ndarrays
        A list of sub-arrays as views into `ary`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `indices_or_sections` is given as an integer, but
        a split does not result in equal division.

    See Also
    --------
    array_split : Split an array into multiple sub-arrays of equal or
                  near-equal size.  Does not raise an exception if
                  an equal division cannot be made.
    hsplit : Split array into multiple sub-arrays horizontally (column-wise).
    vsplit : Split array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row wise).
    dsplit : Split array into multiple sub-arrays along the 3rd axis (depth).
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
    stack : Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
    hstack : Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).
    vstack : Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise).
    dstack : Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third dimension).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(9.0)
    >>> np.split(x, 3)
    [array([0.,  1.,  2.]), array([3.,  4.,  5.]), array([6.,  7.,  8.])]

    >>> x = np.arange(8.0)
    >>> np.split(x, [3, 5, 6, 10])
    [array([0.,  1.,  2.]),
     array([3.,  4.]),
     array([5.]),
     array([6.,  7.]),
     array([], dtype=float64)]

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(9.0)
    >>> np.split(x, 3)
    [array([0.,  1.,  2.]), array([3.,  4.,  5.]), array([6.,  7.,  8.])]

    >>> x = np.arange(8.0)
    >>> np.split(x, [3, 5, 6, 10])
    [array([0.,  1.,  2.]),
     array([3.,  4.]),
     array([5.]),
     array([6.,  7.]),
     array([], dtype=float64)]

    Splitting a 2D array:
    >>> x = np.arange(16.0).reshape(4, 4)
    >>> np.split(x, 2, axis=0)
    [array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.],
             [ 4.,  5.,  6.,  7.]]),
     array([[ 8.,  9., 10., 11.],
             [12., 13., 14., 15.]])]

I decided to add the third example because the existing examples only demonstrate splitting a 1D array. The new example shows how to split a 2D array, which can be useful for users who work with higher-dimensional arrays. This example also demonstrates the use of the `axis` parameter, which is an important aspect of the `split` function.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the `split` function, and the new example provides additional information about splitting higher-dimensional arrays. Adding more examples might make the documentation too verbose and repetitive.
