I will provide you with the docstring for the ediff1d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ediff1d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    The differences between consecutive elements of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ary : array_like
        If necessary, will be flattened before the differences are taken.
    to_end : array_like, optional
        Number(s) to append at the end of the returned differences.
    to_begin : array_like, optional
        Number(s) to prepend at the beginning of the returned differences.

    Returns
    -------
    ediff1d : ndarray
        The differences. Loosely, this is ``ary.flat[1:] - ary.flat[:-1]``.

    See Also
    --------
    diff, gradient

    Notes
    -----
    When applied to masked arrays, this function drops the mask information
    if the `to_begin` and/or `to_end` parameters are used.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 4, 7, 0])
    >>> np.ediff1d(x)
    array([ 1,  2,  3, -7])

    >>> np.ediff1d(x, to_begin=-99, to_end=np.array([88, 99]))
    array([-99,   1,   2, ...,  -7,  88,  99])

    The returned array is always 1D.

    >>> y = [[1, 2, 4], [1, 6, 24]]
    >>> np.ediff1d(y)
    array([ 1,  2, -3,  5, 18])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    The differences between consecutive elements of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ary : array_like
        If necessary, will be flattened before the differences are taken.
    to_end : array_like, optional
        Number(s) to append at the end of the returned differences.
    to_begin : array_like, optional
        Number(s) to prepend at the beginning of the returned differences.

    Returns
    -------
    ediff1d : ndarray
        The differences. Loosely, this is ``ary.flat[1:] - ary.flat[:-1]``.

    See Also
    --------
    diff, gradient

    Notes
    -----
    When applied to masked arrays, this function drops the mask information
    if the `to_begin` and/or `to_end` parameters are used.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 4, 7, 0])
    >>> np.ediff1d(x)
    array([ 1,  2,  3, -7])

    >>> np.ediff1d(x, to_begin=-99, to_end=np.array([88, 99]))
    array([-99,   1,   2, ...,  -7,  88,  99])

    The returned array is always 1D.

    >>> y = [[1, 2, 4], [1, 6, 24]]
    >>> np.ediff1d(y)
    array([ 1,  2, -3,  5, 18])

    Using ediff1d with a single element array:
    >>> z = np.array([5])
    >>> np.ediff1d(z)
    array([], dtype=int64)

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only show the function being used with arrays of multiple elements. This new example demonstrates how the function behaves when given a single-element array, which returns an empty array. I stopped here because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the function, and this additional example provides further insight into its behavior in a specific edge case.
