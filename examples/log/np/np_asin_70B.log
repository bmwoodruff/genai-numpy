I will provide you with the docstring for the asin function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.asin. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

arcsin(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Inverse sine, element-wise.

Parameters
----------
x : array_like
    `y`-coordinate on the unit circle.
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
angle : ndarray
    The inverse sine of each element in `x`, in radians and in the
    closed interval ``[-pi/2, pi/2]``.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

See Also
--------
sin, cos, arccos, tan, arctan, arctan2, emath.arcsin

Notes
-----
`arcsin` is a multivalued function: for each `x` there are infinitely
many numbers `z` such that :math:`sin(z) = x`.  The convention is to
return the angle `z` whose real part lies in [-pi/2, pi/2].

For real-valued input data types, *arcsin* always returns real output.
For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity,
it yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

For complex-valued input, `arcsin` is a complex analytic function that
has, by convention, the branch cuts [-inf, -1] and [1, inf]  and is
continuous from above on the former and from below on the latter.

The inverse sine is also known as `asin` or sin^{-1}.

Examples

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.arcsin(1)     # pi/2
1.5707963267948966
>>> np.arcsin(-1)    # -pi/2
-1.5707963267948966
>>> np.arcsin(0)
0.0
Complex input:
 
>>> np.arcsin(1 + 1j)
(1.5707963267948966+1.5707963267948966j)

I decided to add an example with complex input because the docstring mentions that `arcsin` is a complex analytic function, but there were no examples to demonstrate this. This example shows how `arcsin` behaves with complex input.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `arcsin` with real-valued input, and the new example provides additional insight into its behavior with complex input.
