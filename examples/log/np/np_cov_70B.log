I will provide you with the docstring for the cov function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.cov. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Estimate a covariance matrix, given data and weights.

    Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
    If we examine N-dimensional samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]^T`,
    then the covariance matrix element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of
    :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`. The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance
    of :math:`x_i`.

    See the notes for an outline of the algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
        Each row of `m` represents a variable, and each column a single
        observation of all those variables. Also see `rowvar` below.
    y : array_like, optional
        An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same form
        as that of `m`.
    rowvar : bool, optional
        If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a
        variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship
        is transposed: each column represents a variable, while the rows
        contain observations.
    bias : bool, optional
        Default normalization (False) is by ``(N - 1)``, where ``N`` is the
        number of observations given (unbiased estimate). If `bias` is True,
        then normalization is by ``N``. These values can be overridden by using
        the keyword ``ddof`` in numpy versions >= 1.5.
    ddof : int, optional
        If not ``None`` the default value implied by `bias` is overridden.
        Note that ``ddof=1`` will return the unbiased estimate, even if both
        `fweights` and `aweights` are specified, and ``ddof=0`` will return
        the simple average. See the notes for the details. The default value
        is ``None``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5
    fweights : array_like, int, optional
        1-D array of integer frequency weights; the number of times each
        observation vector should be repeated.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10
    aweights : array_like, optional
        1-D array of observation vector weights. These relative weights are
        typically large for observations considered "important" and smaller for
        observations considered less "important". If ``ddof=0`` the array of
        weights can be used to assign probabilities to observation vectors.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Data-type of the result. By default, the return data-type will have
        at least `numpy.float64` precision.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The covariance matrix of the variables.

    See Also
    --------
    corrcoef : Normalized covariance matrix

    Notes
    -----
    Assume that the observations are in the columns of the observation
    array `m` and let ``f = fweights`` and ``a = aweights`` for brevity. The
    steps to compute the weighted covariance are as follows::

        >>> m = np.arange(10, dtype=np.float64)
        >>> f = np.arange(10) * 2
        >>> a = np.arange(10) ** 2.
        >>> ddof = 1
        >>> w = f * a
        >>> v1 = np.sum(w)
        >>> v2 = np.sum(w * a)
        >>> m -= np.sum(m * w, axis=None, keepdims=True) / v1
        >>> cov = np.dot(m * w, m.T) * v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)

    Note that when ``a == 1``, the normalization factor
    ``v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)`` goes over to ``1 / (np.sum(f) - ddof)``
    as it should.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider two variables, :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, which
    correlate perfectly, but in opposite directions:

    >>> x = np.array([[0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0]]).T
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [2, 1, 0]])

    Note how :math:`x_0` increases while :math:`x_1` decreases. The covariance
    matrix shows this clearly:

    >>> np.cov(x)
    array([[ 1., -1.],
           [-1.,  1.]])

    Note that element :math:`C_{0,1}`, which shows the correlation between
    :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, is negative.

    Further, note how `x` and `y` are combined:

    >>> x = [-2.1, -1,  4.3]
    >>> y = [3,  1.1,  0.12]
    >>> X = np.stack((x, y), axis=0)
    >>> np.cov(X)
    array([[11.71      , -4.286     ], # may vary
           [-4.286     ,  2.144133]])
    >>> np.cov(x, y)
    array([[11.71      , -4.286     ], # may vary
           [-4.286     ,  2.144133]])
    >>> np.cov(x)
    array(11.71)

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    Consider two variables, :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, which
    correlate perfectly, but in opposite directions:

    >>> x = np.array([[0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0]]).T
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [2, 1, 0]])

    Note how :math:`x_0` increases while :math:`x_1` decreases. The covariance
    matrix shows this clearly:

    >>> np.cov(x)
    array([[ 1., -1.],
           [-1.,  1.]])

    Note that element :math:`C_{0,1}`, which shows the correlation between
    :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, is negative.

    Further, note how `x` and `y` are combined:

    >>> x = [-2.1, -1,  4.3]
    >>> y = [3,  1.1,  0.12]
    >>> X = np.stack((x, y), axis=0)
    >>> np.cov(X)
    array([[11.71      , -4.286     ], # may vary
           [-4.286     ,  2.144133]])
    >>> np.cov(x, y)
    array([[11.71      , -4.286     ], # may vary
           [-4.286     ,  2.144133]])
    >>> np.cov(x)
    array(11.71)

    Using rowvar=False:

    >>> x = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0]])
    >>> np.cov(x, rowvar=False)
    array([[ 1., -1.],
           [-1.,  1.]])
