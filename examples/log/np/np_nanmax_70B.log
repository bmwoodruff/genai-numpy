I will provide you with the docstring for the nanmax function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nanmax. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the maximum of an array or maximum along an axis, ignoring any
    NaNs.  When all-NaN slices are encountered a ``RuntimeWarning`` is
    raised and NaN is returned for that slice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose maximum is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the maximum is computed. The default is to compute
        the maximum of the flattened array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary. See
        :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `max` method
        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    initial : scalar, optional
        The minimum value of an output element. Must be present to allow
        computation on empty slice. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to compare for the maximum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    nanmax : ndarray
        An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis removed.
        If `a` is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an ndarray scalar is
        returned.  The same dtype as `a` is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    nanmin :
        The minimum value of an array along a given axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    amax :
        The maximum value of an array along a given axis, propagating any NaNs.
    fmax :
        Element-wise maximum of two arrays, ignoring any NaNs.
    maximum :
        Element-wise maximum of two arrays, propagating any NaNs.
    isnan :
        Shows which elements are Not a Number (NaN).
    isfinite:
        Shows which elements are neither NaN nor infinity.

    amin, fmin, minimum

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
    Positive infinity is treated as a very large number and negative
    infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

    If the input has a integer type the function is equivalent to np.max.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanmax(a)
    3.0
    >>> np.nanmax(a, axis=0)
    array([3.,  2.])
    >>> np.nanmax(a, axis=1)
    array([2.,  3.])

    When positive infinity and negative infinity are present:

    >>> np.nanmax([1, 2, np.nan, -np.inf])
    2.0
    >>> np.nanmax([1, 2, np.nan, np.inf])
    inf

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanmax(a)
    3.0
    >>> np.nanmax(a, axis=0)
    array([3.,  2.])
    >>> np.nanmax(a, axis=1)
    array([2.,  3.])

    When positive infinity and negative infinity are present:

    >>> np.nanmax([1, 2, np.nan, -np.inf])
    2.0
    >>> np.nanmax([1, 2, np.nan, np.inf])
    inf

    Using the initial parameter:

    >>> np.nanmax([np.nan], initial=1)
    1.0

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `initial` parameter, which was introduced in NumPy 1.22.0. This parameter allows the user to specify a minimum value for the output, which is useful when computing the maximum on an empty slice.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the `nanmax` function, including computing the maximum along different axes and handling positive and negative infinity. The additional example I provided demonstrates a specific use case for the `initial` parameter, which is a new feature in NumPy 1.22.0.
