I will provide you with the docstring for the zeros function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.zeros. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

zeros(shape, dtype=float, order='C', *, like=None)

    Return a new array of given shape and type, filled with zeros.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : int or tuple of ints
        Shape of the new array, e.g., ``(2, 3)`` or ``2``.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type for the array, e.g., `numpy.int8`.  Default is
        `numpy.float64`.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional, default: 'C'
        Whether to store multi-dimensional data in row-major
        (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order in
        memory.
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of zeros with the given shape, dtype, and order.

    See Also
    --------
    zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
    empty : Return a new uninitialized array.
    ones : Return a new array setting values to one.
    full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.zeros(5)
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.])

    >>> np.zeros((5,), dtype=int)
    array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

    >>> np.zeros((2, 1))
    array([[ 0.],
           [ 0.]])

    >>> s = (2,2)
    >>> np.zeros(s)
    array([[ 0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.]])

    >>> np.zeros((2,), dtype=[('x', 'i4'), ('y', 'i4')]) # custom dtype
    array([(0, 0), (0, 0)],
          dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.zeros(5)
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.])

    >>> np.zeros((5,), dtype=int)
    array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

    >>> np.zeros((2, 1))
    array([[ 0.],
           [ 0.]])

    >>> s = (2,2)
    >>> np.zeros(s)
    array([[ 0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.]])

    >>> np.zeros((2,), dtype=[('x', 'i4'), ('y', 'i4')]) # custom dtype
    array([(0, 0), (0, 0)],
          dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])

    Creating a 3-dimensional array with zeros:
    
    >>> np.zeros((2, 2, 2))
    array([[[ 0.,  0.],
            [ 0.,  0.]],

           [[ 0.,  0.],
            [ 0.,  0.]]])

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only show 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional arrays, but it's also common to use `np.zeros` to create higher-dimensional arrays. This example demonstrates how to create a 3-dimensional array filled with zeros.

I stopped after adding this one example because the existing examples already cover a good range of use cases, including different shapes, data types, and custom data types. The additional example I added provides further clarity on how to use `np.zeros` for higher-dimensional arrays.
