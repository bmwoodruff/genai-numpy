I will provide you with the docstring for the unique function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.unique. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Find the unique elements of an array.

    Returns the sorted unique elements of an array. There are three optional
    outputs in addition to the unique elements:

    * the indices of the input array that give the unique values
    * the indices of the unique array that reconstruct the input array
    * the number of times each unique value comes up in the input array

    Parameters
    ----------
    ar : array_like
        Input array. Unless `axis` is specified, this will be flattened if it
        is not already 1-D.
    return_index : bool, optional
        If True, also return the indices of `ar` (along the specified axis,
        if provided, or in the flattened array) that result in the unique array.
    return_inverse : bool, optional
        If True, also return the indices of the unique array (for the specified
        axis, if provided) that can be used to reconstruct `ar`.
    return_counts : bool, optional
        If True, also return the number of times each unique item appears
        in `ar`.
    axis : int or None, optional
        The axis to operate on. If None, `ar` will be flattened. If an integer,
        the subarrays indexed by the given axis will be flattened and treated
        as the elements of a 1-D array with the dimension of the given axis,
        see the notes for more details.  Object arrays or structured arrays
        that contain objects are not supported if the `axis` kwarg is used. The
        default is None.

        .. versionadded:: 1.13.0

    equal_nan : bool, optional
        If True, collapses multiple NaN values in the return array into one.

        .. versionadded:: 1.24

    Returns
    -------
    unique : ndarray
        The sorted unique values.
    unique_indices : ndarray, optional
        The indices of the first occurrences of the unique values in the
        original array. Only provided if `return_index` is True.
    unique_inverse : ndarray, optional
        The indices to reconstruct the original array from the
        unique array. Only provided if `return_inverse` is True.
    unique_counts : ndarray, optional
        The number of times each of the unique values comes up in the
        original array. Only provided if `return_counts` is True.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    See Also
    --------
    repeat : Repeat elements of an array.

    Notes
    -----
    When an axis is specified the subarrays indexed by the axis are sorted.
    This is done by making the specified axis the first dimension of the array
    (move the axis to the first dimension to keep the order of the other axes)
    and then flattening the subarrays in C order. The flattened subarrays are
    then viewed as a structured type with each element given a label, with the
    effect that we end up with a 1-D array of structured types that can be
    treated in the same way as any other 1-D array. The result is that the
    flattened subarrays are sorted in lexicographic order starting with the
    first element.

    .. versionchanged: 1.21
        If nan values are in the input array, a single nan is put
        to the end of the sorted unique values.

        Also for complex arrays all NaN values are considered equivalent
        (no matter whether the NaN is in the real or imaginary part).
        As the representant for the returned array the smallest one in the
        lexicographical order is chosen - see np.sort for how the lexicographical
        order is defined for complex arrays.

    .. versionchanged: 2.0
        For multi-dimensional inputs, ``unique_inverse`` is reshaped
        such that the input can be reconstructed using
        ``np.take(unique, unique_inverse)`` when ``axis = None``, and
        ``np.take_along_axis(unique, unique_inverse, axis=axis)`` otherwise.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.unique([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3])
    array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 3]])
    >>> np.unique(a)
    array([1, 2, 3])

    Return the unique rows of a 2D array

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [2, 3, 4]])
    >>> np.unique(a, axis=0)
    array([[1, 0, 0], [2, 3, 4]])

    Return the indices of the original array that give the unique values:

    >>> a = np.array(['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a'])
    >>> u, indices = np.unique(a, return_index=True)
    >>> u
    array(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype='<U1')
    >>> indices
    array([0, 1, 3])
    >>> a[indices]
    array(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype='<U1')

    Reconstruct the input array from the unique values and inverse:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 6, 4, 2, 3, 2])
    >>> u, indices = np.unique(a, return_inverse=True)
    >>> u
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])
    >>> indices
    array([0, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1])
    >>> u[indices]
    array([1, 2, 6, 4, 2, 3, 2])

    Reconstruct the input values from the unique values and counts:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 6, 4, 2, 3, 2])
    >>> values, counts = np.unique(a, return_counts=True)
    >>> values
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])
    >>> counts
    array([1, 3, 1, 1, 1])
    >>> np.repeat(values, counts)
    array([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6])    # original order not preserved
