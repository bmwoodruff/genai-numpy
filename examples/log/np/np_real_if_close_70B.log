I will provide you with the docstring for the real_if_close function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.real_if_close. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    If input is complex with all imaginary parts close to zero, return
    real parts.

    "Close to zero" is defined as `tol` * (machine epsilon of the type for
    `a`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    tol : float
        Tolerance in machine epsilons for the complex part of the elements
        in the array. If the tolerance is <=1, then the absolute tolerance
        is used.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        If `a` is real, the type of `a` is used for the output.  If `a`
        has complex elements, the returned type is float.

    --------
    real, imag, angle

    Notes
    -----
    Machine epsilon varies from machine to machine and between data types
    but Python floats on most platforms have a machine epsilon equal to
    2.2204460492503131e-16.  You can use 'np.finfo(float).eps' to print
    out the machine epsilon for floats.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.finfo(float).eps
    2.2204460492503131e-16 # may vary

    >>> np.real_if_close([2.1 + 4e-14j, 5.2 + 3e-15j], tol=1000)
    array([2.1, 5.2])
    >>> np.real_if_close([2.1 + 4e-13j, 5.2 + 3e-15j], tol=1000)
    array([2.1+4.e-13j, 5.2 + 3e-15j])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.finfo(float).eps
    2.2204460492503131e-16 # may vary

    >>> np.real_if_close([2.1 + 4e-14j, 5.2 + 3e-15j], tol=1000)
    array([2.1, 5.2])
    >>> np.real_if_close([2.1 + 4e-13j, 5.2 + 3e-15j], tol=1000)
    array([2.1+4.e-13j, 5.2 + 3e-15j])

    Default tolerance:
    
    >>> np.real_if_close([2.1 + 4e-17j, 5.2 + 3e-18j])
    array([2.1, 5.2])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the default behavior of `np.real_if_close` when the `tol` parameter is not provided. This example shows that the function uses the machine epsilon as the default tolerance, which is important to understand for users who may not be familiar with this behavior.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of the function, and the additional example provides a clear illustration of the default behavior. Adding more examples at this point would likely be redundant or unnecessary.
