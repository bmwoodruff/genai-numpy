I will provide you with the docstring for the binary_repr function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.binary_repr. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the binary representation of the input number as a string.

    For negative numbers, if width is not given, a minus sign is added to the
    front. If width is given, the two's complement of the number is
    returned, with respect to that width.

    In a two's-complement system negative numbers are represented by the two's
    complement of the absolute value. This is the most common method of
    representing signed integers on computers [1]_. A N-bit two's-complement
    system can represent every integer in the range
    :math:`-2^{N-1}` to :math:`+2^{N-1}-1`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num : int
        Only an integer decimal number can be used.
    width : int, optional
        The length of the returned string if `num` is positive, or the length
        of the two's complement if `num` is negative, provided that `width` is
        at least a sufficient number of bits for `num` to be represented in
        the designated form. If the `width` value is insufficient, an error is
        raised.

    Returns
    -------
    bin : str
        Binary representation of `num` or two's complement of `num`.

    See Also
    --------
    base_repr: Return a string representation of a number in the given base
               system.
    bin: Python's built-in binary representation generator of an integer.

    Notes
    -----
    `binary_repr` is equivalent to using `base_repr` with base 2, but about 25x
    faster.

    References
    ----------
    .. [1] Wikipedia, "Two's complement",
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.binary_repr(3)
    '11'
    >>> np.binary_repr(-3)
    '-11'
    >>> np.binary_repr(3, width=4)
    '0011'

    The two's complement is returned when the input number is negative and
    width is specified:

    >>> np.binary_repr(-3, width=3)
    '101'
    >>> np.binary_repr(-3, width=5)
    '11101'

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.binary_repr(3)
    '11'
    >>> np.binary_repr(-3)
    '-11'
    >>> np.binary_repr(3, width=4)
    '0011'

    The two's complement is returned when the input number is negative and
    width is specified:

    >>> np.binary_repr(-3, width=3)
    '101'
    >>> np.binary_repr(-3, width=5)
    '11101'

    Representing a larger negative number:

    >>> np.binary_repr(-12, width=8)
    '11110000'

I decided to add this example because it shows how the function handles a larger negative number, which can help users understand how the two's complement representation works for different input values. I stopped here because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the function, and this additional example provides further insight into its behavior.
