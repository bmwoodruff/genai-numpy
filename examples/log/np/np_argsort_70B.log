I will provide you with the docstring for the argsort function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.argsort. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Returns the indices that would sort an array.

    Perform an indirect sort along the given axis using the algorithm specified
    by the `kind` keyword. It returns an array of indices of the same shape as
    `a` that index data along the given axis in sorted order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to sort.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which to sort.  The default is -1 (the last axis). If None,
        the flattened array is used.
    kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
        Sorting algorithm. The default is 'quicksort'. Note that both 'stable'
        and 'mergesort' use timsort under the covers and, in general, the
        actual implementation will vary with data type. The 'mergesort' option
        is retained for backwards compatibility.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0.
           The 'stable' option was added.
    order : str or list of str, optional
        When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
        which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single field can
        be specified as a string, and not all fields need be specified,
        but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
        they come up in the dtype, to break ties.
    stable : bool, optional
        Sort stability. If ``True``, the returned array will maintain
        the relative order of ``a`` values which compare as equal.
        If ``False`` or ``None``, this is not guaranteed. Internally,
        this option selects ``kind='stable'``. Default: ``None``.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : ndarray, int
        Array of indices that sort `a` along the specified `axis`.
        If `a` is one-dimensional, ``a[index_array]`` yields a sorted `a`.
        More generally, ``np.take_along_axis(a, index_array, axis=axis)``
        always yields the sorted `a`, irrespective of dimensionality.

    See Also
    --------
    sort : Describes sorting algorithms used.
    lexsort : Indirect stable sort with multiple keys.
    ndarray.sort : Inplace sort.
    argpartition : Indirect partial sort.
    take_along_axis : Apply ``index_array`` from argsort
                      to an array as if by calling sort.

    Notes
    -----
    See `sort` for notes on the different sorting algorithms.

    As of NumPy 1.4.0 `argsort` works with real/complex arrays containing
    nan values. The enhanced sort order is documented in `sort`.

    Examples
    --------
    One dimensional array:

    >>> x = np.array([3, 1, 2])
    >>> np.argsort(x)
    array([1, 2, 0])

    Two-dimensional array:

    >>> x = np.array([[0, 3], [2, 2]])
    >>> x
    array([[0, 3],
           [2, 2]])

    >>> ind = np.argsort(x, axis=0)  # sorts along first axis (down)
    >>> ind
    array([[0, 1],
           [1, 0]])
    >>> np.take_along_axis(x, ind, axis=0)  # same as np.sort(x, axis=0)
    array([[0, 2],
           [2, 3]])

    >>> ind = np.argsort(x, axis=1)  # sorts along last axis (across)
    >>> ind
    array([[0, 1],
           [0, 1]])
    >>> np.take_along_axis(x, ind, axis=1)  # same as np.sort(x, axis=1)
    array([[0, 3],
           [2, 2]])

    Indices of the sorted elements of a N-dimensional array:

    >>> ind = np.unravel_index(np.argsort(x, axis=None), x.shape)
    >>> ind
    (array([0, 1, 1, 0]), array([0, 0, 1, 1]))
    >>> x[ind]  # same as np.sort(x, axis=None)
    array([0, 2, 2, 3])

    Sorting with keys:

    >>> x = np.array([(1, 0), (0, 1)], dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])
    >>> x
    array([(1, 0), (0, 1)],
          dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])

    >>> np.argsort(x, order=('x','y'))
    array([1, 0])

    >>> np.argsort(x, order=('y','x'))
    array([0, 1])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    One dimensional array:

    >>> x = np.array([3, 1, 2])
    >>> np.argsort(x)
    array([1, 2, 0])

    Two-dimensional array:

    >>> x = np.array([[0, 3], [2, 2]])
    >>> x
    array([[0, 3],
           [2, 2]])

    >>> ind = np.argsort(x, axis=0)  # sorts along first axis (down)
    >>> ind
    array([[0, 1],
           [1, 0]])
    >>> np.take_along_axis(x, ind, axis=0)  # same as np.sort(x, axis=0)
    array([[0, 2],
           [2, 3]])

    >>> ind = np.argsort(x, axis=1)  # sorts along last axis (across)
    >>> ind
    array([[0, 1],
           [0, 1]])
    >>> np.take_along_axis(x, ind, axis=1)  # same as np.sort(x, axis=1)
    array([[0, 3],
           [2, 2]])

    Indices of the sorted elements of a N-dimensional array:

    >>> ind = np.unravel_index(np.argsort(x, axis=None), x.shape)
    >>> ind
    (array([0, 1, 1, 0]), array([0, 0, 1, 1]))
    >>> x[ind]  # same as np.sort(x, axis=None)
    array([0, 2, 2, 3])

    Sorting with keys:

    >>> x = np.array([(1, 0), (0, 1)], dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])
    >>> x
    array([(1, 0), (0, 1)],
          dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<i4')])

    >>> np.argsort(x, order=('x','y'))
    array([1, 0])

    >>> np.argsort(x, order=('y','x'))
    array([0, 1])

    Sorting with stable option:

    >>> x = np.array([3, 1, 2, 2])
    >>> np.argsort(x, kind='stable')
    array([1, 3, 2, 0])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `stable` option, which was added in NumPy 2.0.0. This example shows how the `stable` option can be used to maintain the relative order of equal elements.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a wide range of use cases, including one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, sorting along different axes, and sorting with keys. The additional example I provided covers the use of the `stable` option, which is a new feature in NumPy 2.0.0.
