I will provide you with the docstring for the vsplit function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.vsplit. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Split an array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row-wise).

    Please refer to the ``split`` documentation.  ``vsplit`` is equivalent
    to ``split`` with `axis=0` (default), the array is always split along the
    first axis regardless of the array dimension.

    See Also

    split : Split an array into multiple sub-arrays of equal size.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(16.0).reshape(4, 4)
    >>> x
    array([[ 0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
           [ 4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
           [ 8.,   9.,  10.,  11.],
           [12.,  13.,  14.,  15.]])
    >>> np.vsplit(x, 2)
    [array([[0., 1., 2., 3.],
            [4., 5., 6., 7.]]),
     array([[ 8.,  9., 10., 11.],
            [12., 13., 14., 15.]])]
    >>> np.vsplit(x, np.array([3, 6]))
    [array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.],
            [ 4.,  5.,  6.,  7.],
            [ 8.,  9., 10., 11.]]),
     array([[12., 13., 14., 15.]]),
     array([], shape=(0, 4), dtype=float64)]

    With a higher dimensional array the split is still along the first axis.

    >>> x = np.arange(8.0).reshape(2, 2, 2)
    >>> x
    array([[[0.,  1.],
            [2.,  3.]],
           [[4.,  5.],
            [6.,  7.]]])
    >>> np.vsplit(x, 2)
    [array([[[0., 1.],
             [2., 3.]]]),
     array([[[4., 5.],
             [6., 7.]]])]

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Split an array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row-wise).

    Please refer to the ``split`` documentation.  ``vsplit`` is equivalent
    to ``split`` with `axis=0` (default), the array is always split along the
    first axis regardless of the array dimension.

    See Also
    --------
    split : Split an array into multiple sub-arrays of equal size.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(16.0).reshape(4, 4)
    >>> x
    array([[ 0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
           [ 4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
           [ 8.,   9.,  10.,  11.],
           [12.,  13.,  14.,  15.]])
    >>> np.vsplit(x, 2)
    [array([[0., 1., 2., 3.],
            [4., 5., 6., 7.]]),
     array([[ 8.,  9., 10., 11.],
            [12., 13., 14., 15.]])]
    >>> np.vsplit(x, np.array([3, 6]))
    [array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.],
            [ 4.,  5.,  6.,  7.],
            [ 8.,  9., 10., 11.]]),
     array([[12., 13., 14., 15.]]),
     array([], shape=(0, 4), dtype=float64)]

    With a higher dimensional array the split is still along the first axis.

    >>> x = np.arange(8.0).reshape(2, 2, 2)
    >>> x
    array([[[0.,  1.],
            [2.,  3.]],
           [[4.,  5.],
            [6.,  7.]]])
    >>> np.vsplit(x, 2)
    [array([[[0., 1.],
             [2., 3.]]]),
     array([[[4., 5.],
             [6., 7.]]])]

    Splitting an array with a single row:

    >>> x = np.arange(4.0).reshape(1, 4)
    >>> x
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.]])
    >>> np.vsplit(x, 1)
    [array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.]])]

I decided to add this example because it shows the behavior of `np.vsplit` when the input array has a single row. This can be a common use case, and it's useful to demonstrate that `np.vsplit` still works correctly in this scenario.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including splitting an array into multiple sub-arrays of equal size, splitting an array with a custom split point, and splitting a higher-dimensional array. The additional example I added provides further clarity on the behavior of `np.vsplit` in a specific edge case.
