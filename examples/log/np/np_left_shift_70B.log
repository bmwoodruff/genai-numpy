I will provide you with the docstring for the left_shift function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.left_shift. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

left_shift(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Shift the bits of an integer to the left.

Bits are shifted to the left by appending `x2` 0s at the right of `x1`.
Since the internal representation of numbers is in binary format, this
operation is equivalent to multiplying `x1` by ``2**x2``.

Parameters
----------
x1 : array_like of integer type
    Input values.
x2 : array_like of integer type
    Number of zeros to append to `x1`. Has to be non-negative.
    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
out : array of integer type
    Return `x1` with bits shifted `x2` times to the left.
    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

See Also
--------
right_shift : Shift the bits of an integer to the right.
binary_repr : Return the binary representation of the input number
    as a string.

Examples
--------
>>> np.binary_repr(5)
'101'
>>> np.left_shift(5, 2)
20
>>> np.binary_repr(20)
'10100'

>>> np.left_shift(5, [1,2,3])
array([10, 20, 40])

Note that the dtype of the second argument may change the dtype of the
result and can lead to unexpected results in some cases (see
:ref:`Casting Rules <ufuncs.casting>`):

>>> a = np.left_shift(np.uint8(255), np.int64(1))  # Expect 254
>>> print(a, type(a)) # Unexpected result due to upcasting
510 <class 'numpy.int64'>
>>> b = np.left_shift(np.uint8(255), np.uint8(1))
>>> print(b, type(b))
254 <class 'numpy.uint8'>

The ``<<`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.left_shift`` on
ndarrays.

>>> x1 = 5
>>> x2 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
>>> x1 << x2
array([10, 20, 40])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.binary_repr(5)
'101'
>>> np.left_shift(5, 2)
20
>>> np.binary_repr(20)
'10100'

>>> np.left_shift(5, [1,2,3])
array([10, 20, 40])

Note that the dtype of the second argument may change the dtype of the
result and can lead to unexpected results in some cases (see
:ref:`Casting Rules <ufuncs.casting>`):

>>> a = np.left_shift(np.uint8(255), np.int64(1))  # Expect 254
>>> print(a, type(a)) # Unexpected result due to upcasting
510 <class 'numpy.int64'>
>>> b = np.left_shift(np.uint8(255), np.uint8(1))
>>> print(b, type(b))
254 <class 'numpy.uint8'

The ``<<`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.left_shift`` on
ndarrays.

>>> x1 = 5
>>> x2 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
>>> x1 << x2
array([10, 20, 40])

Shift by zero:
>>> np.left_shift(5, 0)
5
