I will provide you with the docstring for the cosh function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.cosh. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

cosh(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Hyperbolic cosine, element-wise.

Equivalent to ``1/2 * (np.exp(x) + np.exp(-x))`` and ``np.cos(1j*x)``.

Parameters
----------
x : array_like
    Input array.
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
out : ndarray or scalar
    Output array of same shape as `x`.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

Examples
--------
>>> np.cosh(0)
1.0

The hyperbolic cosine describes the shape of a hanging cable:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 1000)
>>> plt.plot(x, np.cosh(x))
>>> plt.show()

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.cosh(0)
1.0

The hyperbolic cosine describes the shape of a hanging cable:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 1000)
>>> plt.plot(x, np.cosh(x))
>>> plt.show()

Using cosh with negative input:

>>> np.cosh(-2)
3.7621956910836314

I decided to add the third example because the existing examples only show the function being used with positive input values. Adding an example with a negative input value helps to demonstrate the function's behavior in a different scenario, making the documentation more comprehensive.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already provide a good understanding of the function's behavior, and the additional example I added covers a different input scenario. Further examples may be redundant or not provide significant additional insight.
