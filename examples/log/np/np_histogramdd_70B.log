I will provide you with the docstring for the histogramdd function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.histogramdd. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the multidimensional histogram of some data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : (N, D) array, or (N, D) array_like
        The data to be histogrammed.

        Note the unusual interpretation of sample when an array_like:

        * When an array, each row is a coordinate in a D-dimensional space -
          such as ``histogramdd(np.array([p1, p2, p3]))``.
        * When an array_like, each element is the list of values for single
          coordinate - such as ``histogramdd((X, Y, Z))``.

        The first form should be preferred.

    bins : sequence or int, optional
        The bin specification:

        * A sequence of arrays describing the monotonically increasing bin
          edges along each dimension.
        * The number of bins for each dimension (nx, ny, ... =bins)
        * The number of bins for all dimensions (nx=ny=...=bins).

    range : sequence, optional
        A sequence of length D, each an optional (lower, upper) tuple giving
        the outer bin edges to be used if the edges are not given explicitly in
        `bins`.
        An entry of None in the sequence results in the minimum and maximum
        values being used for the corresponding dimension.
        The default, None, is equivalent to passing a tuple of D None values.
    density : bool, optional
        If False, the default, returns the number of samples in each bin.
        If True, returns the probability *density* function at the bin,
        ``bin_count / sample_count / bin_volume``.
    weights : (N,) array_like, optional
        An array of values `w_i` weighing each sample `(x_i, y_i, z_i, ...)`.
        Weights are normalized to 1 if density is True. If density is False,
        the values of the returned histogram are equal to the sum of the
        weights belonging to the samples falling into each bin.

    Returns
    -------
    H : ndarray
        The multidimensional histogram of sample x. See density and weights
        for the different possible semantics.
    edges : tuple of ndarrays
        A tuple of D arrays describing the bin edges for each dimension.

    See Also
    --------
    histogram: 1-D histogram
    histogram2d: 2-D histogram

    Examples
    --------
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> r = rng.normal(size=(100,3))
    >>> H, edges = np.histogramdd(r, bins = (5, 8, 4))
    >>> H.shape, edges[0].size, edges[1].size, edges[2].size
    ((5, 8, 4), 6, 9, 5)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> r = rng.normal(size=(100,3))
    >>> H, edges = np.histogramdd(r, bins = (5, 8, 4))
    >>> H.shape, edges[0].size, edges[1].size, edges[2].size
    ((5, 8, 4), 6, 9, 5)

    Using weights:
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> r = rng.normal(size=(100,3))
    >>> w = rng.uniform(size=100)
    >>> H, edges = np.histogramdd(r, bins = (5, 8, 4), weights=w)
    >>> H.shape, edges[0].size, edges[1].size, edges[2].size
    ((5, 8, 4), 6, 9, 5)

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of weights in the histogramdd function. This is an important feature of the function, and including an example helps to illustrate how to use it correctly.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic usage of the function, and the new example covers the additional feature of using weights. With these two examples, users should have a good understanding of how to use the histogramdd function in different scenarios.
