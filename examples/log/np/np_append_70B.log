I will provide you with the docstring for the append function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.append. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Append values to the end of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
        Values are appended to a copy of this array.
    values : array_like
        These values are appended to a copy of `arr`.  It must be of the
        correct shape (the same shape as `arr`, excluding `axis`).  If
        `axis` is not specified, `values` can be any shape and will be
        flattened before use.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which `values` are appended.  If `axis` is not
        given, both `arr` and `values` are flattened before use.

    Returns
    -------
    append : ndarray
        A copy of `arr` with `values` appended to `axis`.  Note that
        `append` does not occur in-place: a new array is allocated and
        filled.  If `axis` is None, `out` is a flattened array.

    See Also
    --------
    insert : Insert elements into an array.
    delete : Delete elements from an array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.append([1, 2, 3], [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    array([1, 2, 3, ..., 7, 8, 9])

    When `axis` is specified, `values` must have the correct shape.

    >>> np.append([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9]], axis=0)
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]])

    >>> np.append([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [7, 8, 9], axis=0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but
    the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 1 has 1
    dimension(s)

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2], dtype=int)
    >>> c = np.append(a, [])
    >>> c
    array([1., 2.])
    >>> c.dtype
    float64

    Default dtype for empty ndarrays is `float64` thus making the output of dtype
    `float64` when appended with dtype `int64`

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Append values to the end of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
        Values are appended to a copy of this array.
    values : array_like
        These values are appended to a copy of `arr`.  It must be of the
        correct shape (the same shape as `arr`, excluding `axis`).  If
        `axis` is not specified, `values` can be any shape and will be
        flattened before use.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which `values` are appended.  If `axis` is not
        given, both `arr` and `values` are flattened before use.

    Returns
    -------
    append : ndarray
        A copy of `arr` with `values` appended to `axis`.  Note that
        `append` does not occur in-place: a new array is allocated and
        filled.  If `axis` is None, `out` is a flattened array.

    See Also
    --------
    insert : Insert elements into an array.
    delete : Delete elements from an array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.append([1, 2, 3], [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    array([1, 2, 3, ..., 7, 8, 9])

    When `axis` is specified, `values` must have the correct shape.

    >>> np.append([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9]], axis=0)
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]])

    >>> np.append([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [7, 8, 9], axis=0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but
    the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 1 has 1
    dimension(s)

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2], dtype=int)
    >>> c = np.append(a, [])
    >>> c
    array([1., 2.])
    >>> c.dtype
    float64

    Default dtype for empty ndarrays is `float64` thus making the output of dtype
    `float64` when appended with dtype `int64`

    Appending to a multidimensional array:
    >>> arr = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
    >>> np.append(arr, [[[9, 10], [11, 12]]], axis=0)
    array([[[ 1,  2],
            [ 3,  4]],

           [[ 5,  6],
            [ 7,  8]],

           [[ 9, 10],
            [11, 12]]])
