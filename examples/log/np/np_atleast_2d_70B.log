I will provide you with the docstring for the atleast_2d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.atleast_2d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    View inputs as arrays with at least two dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arys1, arys2, ... : array_like
        One or more array-like sequences.  Non-array inputs are converted
        to arrays.  Arrays that already have two or more dimensions are
        preserved.

    Returns
    -------
    res, res2, ... : ndarray
        An array, or tuple of arrays, each with ``a.ndim >= 2``.
        Copies are avoided where possible, and views with two or more
        dimensions are returned.

    See Also
    --------
    atleast_1d, atleast_3d

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.atleast_2d(3.0)
    array([[3.]])

    >>> x = np.arange(3.0)
    >>> np.atleast_2d(x)
    array([[0., 1., 2.]])
    >>> np.atleast_2d(x).base is x
    True

    >>> np.atleast_2d(1, [1, 2], [[1, 2]])
    (array([[1]]), array([[1, 2]]), array([[1, 2]]))

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    View inputs as arrays with at least two dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arys1, arys2, ... : array_like
        One or more array-like sequences.  Non-array inputs are converted
        to arrays.  Arrays that already have two or more dimensions are
        preserved.

    Returns
    -------
    res, res2, ... : ndarray
        An array, or tuple of arrays, each with ``a.ndim >= 2``.
        Copies are avoided where possible, and views with two or more
        dimensions are returned.

    See Also
    --------
    atleast_1d, atleast_3d

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.atleast_2d(3.0)
    array([[3.]])

    >>> x = np.arange(3.0)
    >>> np.atleast_2d(x)
    array([[0., 1., 2.]])
    >>> np.atleast_2d(x).base is x
    True

    >>> np.atleast_2d(1, [1, 2], [[1, 2]])
    (array([[1]]), array([[1, 2]]), array([[1, 2]]))

    Passing a 2D array:
    >>> y = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.atleast_2d(y)
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4]])
