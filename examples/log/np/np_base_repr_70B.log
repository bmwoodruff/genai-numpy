I will provide you with the docstring for the base_repr function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.base_repr. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return a string representation of a number in the given base system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    number : int
        The value to convert. Positive and negative values are handled.
    base : int, optional
        Convert `number` to the `base` number system. The valid range is 2-36,
        the default value is 2.
    padding : int, optional
        Number of zeros padded on the left. Default is 0 (no padding).

    Returns
    -------
    out : str
        String representation of `number` in `base` system.

    See Also
    --------
    binary_repr : Faster version of `base_repr` for base 2.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.base_repr(5)
    '101'
    >>> np.base_repr(6, 5)
    '11'
    >>> np.base_repr(7, base=5, padding=3)
    '00012'

    >>> np.base_repr(10, base=16)
    'A'
    >>> np.base_repr(32, base=16)
    '20'

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return a string representation of a number in the given base system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    number : int
        The value to convert. Positive and negative values are handled.
    base : int, optional
        Convert `number` to the `base` number system. The valid range is 2-36,
        the default value is 2.
    padding : int, optional
        Number of zeros padded on the left. Default is 0 (no padding).

    Returns
    -------
    out : str
        String representation of `number` in `base` system.

    See Also
    --------
    binary_repr : Faster version of `base_repr` for base 2.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.base_repr(5)
    '101'
    >>> np.base_repr(6, 5)
    '11'
    >>> np.base_repr(7, base=5, padding=3)
    '00012'

    >>> np.base_repr(10, base=16)
    'A'
    >>> np.base_repr(32, base=16)
    '20'

    Negative Number Representation:
    
    >>> np.base_repr(-10, base=16)
    '-A'

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how negative numbers are represented in different base systems. This is an important aspect of the function's behavior that was not previously covered in the examples.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a variety of use cases, including converting positive numbers to different base systems (binary, base 5, and hexadecimal) with and without padding. The additional example I added provides further insight into the function's behavior, but further examples may not add significant value to the documentation.
