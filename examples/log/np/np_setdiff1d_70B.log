I will provide you with the docstring for the setdiff1d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.setdiff1d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Find the set difference of two arrays.

    Return the unique values in `ar1` that are not in `ar2`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ar1 : array_like
        Input array.
    ar2 : array_like
        Input comparison array.
    assume_unique : bool
        If True, the input arrays are both assumed to be unique, which
        can speed up the calculation.  Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    setdiff1d : ndarray
        1D array of values in `ar1` that are not in `ar2`. The result
        is sorted when `assume_unique=False`, but otherwise only sorted
        if the input is sorted.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1])
    >>> b = np.array([3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.setdiff1d(a, b)
    array([1, 2])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Find the set difference of two arrays.

    Return the unique values in `ar1` that are not in `ar2`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ar1 : array_like
        Input array.
    ar2 : array_like
        Input comparison array.
    assume_unique : bool
        If True, the input arrays are both assumed to be unique, which
        can speed up the calculation.  Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    setdiff1d : ndarray
        1D array of values in `ar1` that are not in `ar2`. The result
        is sorted when `assume_unique=False`, but otherwise only sorted
        if the input is sorted.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1])
    >>> b = np.array([3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.setdiff1d(a, b)
    array([1, 2])
    
    Case with duplicates in ar1 and assume_unique=True:
    
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1])
    >>> b = np.array([3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.setdiff1d(a, b, assume_unique=True)
    array([1, 2])
