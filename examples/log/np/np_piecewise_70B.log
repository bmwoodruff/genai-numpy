I will provide you with the docstring for the piecewise function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.piecewise. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Evaluate a piecewise-defined function.

    Given a set of conditions and corresponding functions, evaluate each
    function on the input data wherever its condition is true.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray or scalar
        The input domain.
    condlist : list of bool arrays or bool scalars
        Each boolean array corresponds to a function in `funclist`.  Wherever
        `condlist[i]` is True, `funclist[i](x)` is used as the output value.

        Each boolean array in `condlist` selects a piece of `x`,
        and should therefore be of the same shape as `x`.

        The length of `condlist` must correspond to that of `funclist`.
        If one extra function is given, i.e. if
        ``len(funclist) == len(condlist) + 1``, then that extra function
        is the default value, used wherever all conditions are false.
    funclist : list of callables, f(x,*args,**kw), or scalars
        Each function is evaluated over `x` wherever its corresponding
        condition is True.  It should take a 1d array as input and give an 1d
        array or a scalar value as output.  If, instead of a callable,
        a scalar is provided then a constant function (``lambda x: scalar``) is
        assumed.
    args : tuple, optional
        Any further arguments given to `piecewise` are passed to the functions
        upon execution, i.e., if called ``piecewise(..., ..., 1, 'a')``, then
        each function is called as ``f(x, 1, 'a')``.
    kw : dict, optional
        Keyword arguments used in calling `piecewise` are passed to the
        functions upon execution, i.e., if called
        ``piecewise(..., ..., alpha=1)``, then each function is called as
        ``f(x, alpha=1)``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The output is the same shape and type as x and is found by
        calling the functions in `funclist` on the appropriate portions of `x`,
        as defined by the boolean arrays in `condlist`.  Portions not covered
        by any condition have a default value of 0.


    See Also
    --------
    choose, select, where

    Notes
    -----
    This is similar to choose or select, except that functions are
    evaluated on elements of `x` that satisfy the corresponding condition from
    `condlist`.

    The result is::

            |--
            |funclist[0](x[condlist[0]])
      out = |funclist[1](x[condlist[1]])
            |...
            |funclist[n2](x[condlist[n2]])
            |--

    Examples
    --------
    Define the signum function, which is -1 for ``x < 0`` and +1 for ``x >= 0``.

    >>> x = np.linspace(-2.5, 2.5, 6)
    >>> np.piecewise(x, [x < 0, x >= 0], [-1, 1])
    array([-1., -1., -1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])

    Define the absolute value, which is ``-x`` for ``x <0`` and ``x`` for
    ``x >= 0``.

    >>> np.piecewise(x, [x < 0, x >= 0], [lambda x: -x, lambda x: x])
    array([2.5,  1.5,  0.5,  0.5,  1.5,  2.5])

    Apply the same function to a scalar value.

    >>> y = -2
    >>> np.piecewise(y, [y < 0, y >= 0], [lambda x: -x, lambda x: x])
    array(2)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    Define the signum function, which is -1 for ``x < 0`` and +1 for ``x >= 0``.

    >>> x = np.linspace(-2.5, 2.5, 6)
    >>> np.piecewise(x, [x < 0, x >= 0], [-1, 1])
    array([-1., -1., -1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])

    Define the absolute value, which is ``-x`` for ``x <0`` and ``x`` for
    ``x >= 0``.

    >>> np.piecewise(x, [x < 0, x >= 0], [lambda x: -x, lambda x: x])
    array([2.5,  1.5,  0.5,  0.5,  1.5,  2.5])

    Apply the same function to a scalar value.

    >>> y = -2
    >>> np.piecewise(y, [y < 0, y >= 0], [lambda x: -x, lambda x: x])
    array(2)

    Using piecewise with multiple conditions and functions.

    >>> x = np.linspace(-2.5, 2.5, 6)
    >>> np.piecewise(x, [x < -1, (x >= -1) & (x < 1), x >= 1], [-2, 1, 2])
    array([-2., -2.,  1.,  1.,  2.,  2.])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of `np.piecewise` with multiple conditions and functions. This example shows how to apply different functions to different parts of the input array based on multiple conditions.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.piecewise`, including defining a simple function, applying the same function to a scalar value, and using lambda functions. The additional example I provided demonstrates a more complex use case, but further examples may not add significant value to the documentation.
