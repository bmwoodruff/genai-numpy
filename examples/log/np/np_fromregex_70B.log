I will provide you with the docstring for the fromregex function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fromregex. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Construct an array from a text file, using regular expression parsing.

    The returned array is always a structured array, and is constructed from
    all matches of the regular expression in the file. Groups in the regular
    expression are converted to fields of the structured array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : file, str, or pathlib.Path
        Filename or file object to read.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.22.0
            Now accepts `os.PathLike` implementations.
    regexp : str or regexp
        Regular expression used to parse the file.
        Groups in the regular expression correspond to fields in the dtype.
    dtype : dtype or list of dtypes
        Dtype for the structured array; must be a structured datatype.
    encoding : str, optional
        Encoding used to decode the inputfile. Does not apply to input streams.

        .. versionadded:: 1.14.0

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        The output array, containing the part of the content of `file` that
        was matched by `regexp`. `output` is always a structured array.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        When `dtype` is not a valid dtype for a structured array.

    See Also
    --------
    fromstring, loadtxt

    Notes
    -----
    Dtypes for structured arrays can be specified in several forms, but all
    forms specify at least the data type and field name. For details see
    `basics.rec`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> text = StringIO("1312 foo\n1534  bar\n444   qux")

    >>> regexp = r"(\d+)\s+(...)"  # match [digits, whitespace, anything]
    >>> output = np.fromregex(text, regexp,
    ...                       [('num', np.int64), ('key', 'S3')])
    >>> output
    array([(1312, b'foo'), (1534, b'bar'), ( 444, b'qux')],
          dtype=[('num', '<i8'), ('key', 'S3')])
    >>> output['num']
    array([1312, 1534,  444])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> text = StringIO("1312 foo\n1534  bar\n444   qux")

    >>> regexp = r"(\d+)\s+(...)"  # match [digits, whitespace, anything]
    >>> output = np.fromregex(text, regexp,
    ...                       [('num', np.int64), ('key', 'S3')])
    >>> output
    array([(1312, b'foo'), (1534, b'bar'), ( 444, b'qux')],
          dtype=[('num', '<i8'), ('key', 'S3')])
    >>> output['num']
    array([1312, 1534,  444])

    Using np.fromregex with a file:
    
    >>> with open('test.txt', 'w') as f:
    ...     f.write("1312 foo\n1534  bar\n444   qux")
    >>> regexp = r"(\d+)\s+(...)"  # match [digits, whitespace, anything]
    >>> output = np.fromregex('test.txt', regexp,
    ...                       [('num', np.int64), ('key', 'S3')])
    >>> output
    array([(1312, b'foo'), (1534, b'bar'), ( 444, b'qux')],
          dtype=[('num', '<i8'), ('key', 'S3')])

I decided to add this example because the original docstring only showed how to use `np.fromregex` with a `StringIO` object, but it didn't demonstrate how to use it with a file. This example shows how to use `np.fromregex` with a file, which is a common use case.

I stopped after adding one example because the original docstring already provided a good demonstration of how to use `np.fromregex`, and the additional example I added covered a different use case. Adding more examples would have been redundant and wouldn't have provided any new insights into how to use the function.
