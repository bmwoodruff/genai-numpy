I will provide you with the docstring for the blackman function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.blackman. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the Blackman window.

    The Blackman window is a taper formed by using the first three
    terms of a summation of cosines. It was designed to have close to the
    minimal leakage possible.  It is close to optimal, only slightly worse
    than a Kaiser window.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an empty
        array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The window, with the maximum value normalized to one (the value one
        appears only if the number of samples is odd).

    Notes
    -----
    The Blackman window is defined as

    .. math::  w(n) = 0.42 - 0.5 \cos(2\pi n/M) + 0.08 \cos(4\pi n/M)

    Most references to the Blackman window come from the signal processing
    literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
    smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
    "removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
    and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function. It is known as a
    "near optimal" tapering function, almost as good (by some measures)
    as the kaiser window.
