I will provide you with the docstring for the min function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.min. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the minimum of an array or minimum along an axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to operate.  By default, flattened input is
        used.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, the minimum is selected over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result.  Must
        be of the same shape and buffer length as the expected output.
        See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the ``min`` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    initial : scalar, optional
        The maximum value of an output element. Must be present to allow
        computation on empty slice. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to compare for the minimum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17.0

    Returns
    -------
    min : ndarray or scalar
        Minimum of `a`. If `axis` is None, the result is a scalar value.
        If `axis` is an int, the result is an array of dimension
        ``a.ndim - 1``.  If `axis` is a tuple, the result is an array of
        dimension ``a.ndim - len(axis)``.

    See Also
    --------
    amax :
        The maximum value of an array along a given axis, propagating any NaNs.
    nanmin :
        The minimum value of an array along a given axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    minimum :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, propagating any NaNs.
    fmin :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, ignoring any NaNs.
    argmin :
        Return the indices of the minimum values.

    nanmax, maximum, fmax

    Notes
    -----
    NaN values are propagated, that is if at least one item is NaN, the
    corresponding min value will be NaN as well. To ignore NaN values
    (MATLAB behavior), please use nanmin.

    Don't use `~numpy.min` for element-wise comparison of 2 arrays; when
    ``a.shape[0]`` is 2, ``minimum(a[0], a[1])`` is faster than
    ``min(a, axis=0)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])
    >>> np.min(a)           # Minimum of the flattened array
    0
    >>> np.min(a, axis=0)   # Minima along the first axis
    array([0, 1])
    >>> np.min(a, axis=1)   # Minima along the second axis
    array([0, 2])
    >>> np.min(a, where=[False, True], initial=10, axis=0)
    array([10,  1])

    >>> b = np.arange(5, dtype=float)
    >>> b[2] = np.nan
    >>> np.min(b)
    np.float64(nan)
    >>> np.min(b, where=~np.isnan(b), initial=10)
    0.0
    >>> np.nanmin(b)
    0.0

    >>> np.min([[-50], [10]], axis=-1, initial=0)
    array([-50,   0])

    Notice that the initial value is used as one of the elements for which the
    minimum is determined, unlike for the default argument Python's max
    function, which is only used for empty iterables.

    Notice that this isn't the same as Python's ``default`` argument.

    >>> np.min([6], initial=5)
    5
    >>> min([6], default=5)
    6

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3]])
    >>> np.min(a)           # Minimum of the flattened array
    0
    >>> np.min(a, axis=0)   # Minima along the first axis
    array([0, 1])
    >>> np.min(a, axis=1)   # Minima along the second axis
    array([0, 2])
    >>> np.min(a, where=[False, True], initial=10, axis=0)
    array([10,  1])

    >>> b = np.arange(5, dtype=float)
    >>> b[2] = np.nan
    >>> np.min(b)
    np.float64(nan)
    >>> np.min(b, where=~np.isnan(b), initial=10)
    0.0
    >>> np.nanmin(b)
    0.0

    >>> np.min([[-50], [10]], axis=-1, initial=0)
    array([-50,   0])

    Notice that the initial value is used as one of the elements for which the
    minimum is determined, unlike for the default argument Python's max
    function, which is only used for empty iterables.

    Notice that this isn't the same as Python's ``default`` argument.

    >>> np.min([6], initial=5)
    5
    >>> min([6], default=5)
    6

    Using keepdims:
    >>> a = np.arange(4).reshape((2,2))
    >>> np.min(a, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[0],
           [2]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `keepdims` parameter, which is an important feature of the `min` function. This example shows how `keepdims` can be used to preserve the shape of the input array.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a wide range of use cases, including different axis values, the use of `where` and `initial` parameters, and the behavior with NaN values. The additional example I provided fills a gap in the documentation by demonstrating the use of `keepdims`.
