I will provide you with the docstring for the var function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.var. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the variance along the specified axis.

    Returns the variance of the array elements, a measure of the spread of a
    distribution.  The variance is computed for the flattened array by
    default, otherwise over the specified axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which the variance is computed.  The default is to
        compute the variance of the flattened array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a variance is performed over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the variance.  For arrays of integer type
        the default is `float64`; for arrays of float types it is the same as
        the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type is cast if
        necessary.
    ddof : {int, float}, optional
        "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
        ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of elements. By
        default `ddof` is zero. See notes for details about use of `ddof`.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `var` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the variance. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for
        details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    mean : array like, optional
        Provide the mean to prevent its recalculation. The mean should have
        a shape as if it was calculated with ``keepdims=True``.
        The axis for the calculation of the mean should be the same as used in
        the call to this var function.

        .. versionadded:: 1.26.0

    correction : {int, float}, optional
        Array API compatible name for the ``ddof`` parameter. Only one of them
        can be provided at the same time.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    variance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If ``out=None``, returns a new array containing the variance;
        otherwise, a reference to the output array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    std, mean, nanmean, nanstd, nanvar
    :ref:`ufuncs-output-type`

    Notes
    -----
    There are several common variants of the array variance calculation.
    Assuming the input `a` is a one-dimensional NumPy array and ``mean`` is
    either provided as an argument or computed as ``a.mean()``, NumPy
    computes the variance of an array as::

        N = len(a)
        d2 = abs(a - mean)**2  # abs is for complex `a`
        var = d2.sum() / (N - ddof)  # note use of `ddof`

    Different values of the argument `ddof` are useful in different
    contexts. NumPy's default ``ddof=0`` corresponds with the expression:

    .. math::

        \frac{\sum_i{|a_i - \bar{a}|^2 }}{N}

    which is sometimes called the "population variance" in the field of
    statistics because it applies the definition of variance to `a` as if `a`
    were a complete population of possible observations.

    Many other libraries define the variance of an array differently, e.g.:

    .. math::

        \frac{\sum_i{|a_i - \bar{a}|^2}}{N - 1}

    In statistics, the resulting quantity is sometimed called the "sample
    variance" because if `a` is a random sample from a larger population,
    this calculation provides an unbiased estimate of the variance of the
    population.  The use of :math:`N-1` in the denominator is often called
    "Bessel's correction" because it corrects for bias (toward lower values)
    in the variance estimate introduced when the sample mean of `a` is used
    in place of the true mean of the population. For this quantity, use
    ``ddof=1``.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.var(a)
    1.25
    >>> np.var(a, axis=0)
    array([1.,  1.])
    >>> np.var(a, axis=1)
    array([0.25,  0.25])

    In single precision, var() can be inaccurate:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0
    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1
    >>> np.var(a)
    0.20250003

    Computing the variance in float64 is more accurate:

    >>> np.var(a, dtype=np.float64)
    0.20249999932944759 # may vary
    >>> ((1-0.55)**2 + (0.1-0.55)**2)/2
    0.2025

    Specifying a where argument:

    >>> a = np.array([[14, 8, 11, 10], [7, 9, 10, 11], [10, 15, 5, 10]])
    >>> np.var(a)
    6.833333333333333 # may vary
    >>> np.var(a, where=[[True], [True], [False]])
    4.0

    Using the mean keyword to save computation time:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from timeit import timeit
    >>>
    >>> a = np.array([[14, 8, 11, 10], [7, 9, 10, 11], [10, 15, 5, 10]])
    >>> mean = np.mean(a, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    >>>
    >>> g = globals()
    >>> n = 10000
    >>> t1 = timeit("var = np.var(a, axis=1, mean=mean)", globals=g, number=n)
    >>> t2 = timeit("var = np.var(a, axis=1)", globals=g, number=n)
    >>> print(f'Percentage execution time saved {100*(t2-t1)/t2:.0f}%')
    #doctest: +SKIP
    Percentage execution time saved 32%

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Compute the variance along the specified axis.

    Returns the variance of the array elements, a measure of the spread of a
    distribution.  The variance is computed for the flattened array by
    default, otherwise over the specified axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which the variance is computed.  The default is to
        compute the variance of the flattened array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a variance is performed over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the variance.  For arrays of integer type
        the default is `float64`; for arrays of float types it is the same as
        the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type is cast if
        necessary.
    ddof : {int, float}, optional
        "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
        ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of elements. By
        default `ddof` is zero. See notes for details about use of `ddof`.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `var` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the variance. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for
        details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    mean : array like, optional
        Provide the mean to prevent its recalculation. The mean should have
        a shape as if it was calculated with ``keepdims=True``.
        The axis for the calculation of the mean should be the same as used in
        the call to this var function.

        .. versionadded:: 1.26.0

    correction : {int, float}, optional
        Array API compatible name for the ``ddof`` parameter. Only one of them
        can be provided at the same time.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    variance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If ``out=None``, returns a new array containing the variance;
        otherwise, a reference to the output array is returned.

    There are several common variants of the array variance calculation.

        N = len(a)
        d2 = abs(a - mean)**2  # abs is for complex `a`
        var = d2.sum() / (N - ddof)  # note use of `ddof`

    Different values of the argument `ddof` are useful in different
    contexts. NumPy's default ``ddof=0`` corresponds with the expression:

    .. math::

        \frac{\sum_i{|a_i - \bar{a}|^2 }}{N}

    which is sometimes called the "population variance" in the field of
    statistics because it applies the definition of variance to `a` as if `a`
    were a complete population of possible observations.

    Many other libraries define the variance of an array differently, e.g.:

    .. math::

        \frac{\sum_i{|a_i - \bar{a}|^2}}{N - 1}

    In statistics, the resulting quantity is sometimed called the "sample
    variance" because if `a` is a random sample from a larger population,
    this calculation provides an unbiased estimate of the variance of the
    population.  The use of :math:`N-1` in the denominator is often called
    "Bessel's correction" because it corrects for bias (toward lower values)
    in the variance estimate introduced when the sample mean of `a` is used
    in place of the true mean of the population. For this quantity, use
    ``ddof=1``.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same

    In single precision, var() can be inaccurate:
