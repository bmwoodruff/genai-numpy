I will provide you with the docstring for the prod function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.prod. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the product of array elements over a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a product is performed.  The default,
        axis=None, will calculate the product of all the elements in the
        input array. If axis is negative it counts from the last to the
        first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If axis is a tuple of ints, a product is performed on all of the
        axes specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the
        axes as before.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in
        which the elements are multiplied.  The dtype of `a` is used by
        default unless `a` has an integer dtype of less precision than the
        default platform integer.  In that case, if `a` is signed then the
        platform integer is used while if `a` is unsigned then an unsigned
        integer of the same precision as the platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the output
        values will be cast if necessary.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the
        result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result
        will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `prod` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial : scalar, optional
        The starting value for this product. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the product. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17.0

    Returns
    -------
    product_along_axis : ndarray, see `dtype` parameter above.
        An array shaped as `a` but with the specified axis removed.
        Returns a reference to `out` if specified.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.prod : equivalent method
    :ref:`ufuncs-output-type`

    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
    raised on overflow.  That means that, on a 32-bit platform:

    >>> x = np.array([536870910, 536870910, 536870910, 536870910])
    >>> np.prod(x)
    16 # may vary

    The product of an empty array is the neutral element 1:

    >>> np.prod([])
    1.0

    Examples
    --------
    By default, calculate the product of all elements:

    >>> np.prod([1.,2.])
    2.0

    Even when the input array is two-dimensional:

    >>> a = np.array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
    >>> np.prod(a)
    24.0

    But we can also specify the axis over which to multiply:

    >>> np.prod(a, axis=1)
    array([  2.,  12.])
    >>> np.prod(a, axis=0)
    array([3., 8.])

    Or select specific elements to include:

    >>> np.prod([1., np.nan, 3.], where=[True, False, True])
    3.0

    If the type of `x` is unsigned, then the output type is
    the unsigned platform integer:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == np.uint
    True

    If `x` is of a signed integer type, then the output type
    is the default platform integer:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == int
    True

    You can also start the product with a value other than one:

    >>> np.prod([1, 2], initial=5)
    10

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    By default, calculate the product of all elements:

    >>> np.prod([1.,2.])
    2.0

    Even when the input array is two-dimensional:

    >>> a = np.array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
    >>> np.prod(a)
    24.0

    But we can also specify the axis over which to multiply:

    >>> np.prod(a, axis=1)
    array([  2.,  12.])
    >>> np.prod(a, axis=0)
    array([3., 8.])

    Or select specific elements to include:

    >>> np.prod([1., np.nan, 3.], where=[True, False, True])
    3.0

    If the type of `x` is unsigned, then the output type is
    the unsigned platform integer:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == np.uint
    True

    If `x` is of a signed integer type, then the output type
    is the default platform integer:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == int
    True

    You can also start the product with a value other than one:

    >>> np.prod([1, 2], initial=5)
    10

    Specifying an output array:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> out = np.zeros(())
    >>> np.prod(a, out=out)
    >>> out
