I will provide you with the docstring for the select function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.select. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return an array drawn from elements in choicelist, depending on conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    condlist : list of bool ndarrays
        The list of conditions which determine from which array in `choicelist`
        the output elements are taken. When multiple conditions are satisfied,
        the first one encountered in `condlist` is used.
    choicelist : list of ndarrays
        The list of arrays from which the output elements are taken. It has
        to be of the same length as `condlist`.
    default : scalar, optional
        The element inserted in `output` when all conditions evaluate to False.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        The output at position m is the m-th element of the array in
        `choicelist` where the m-th element of the corresponding array in
        `condlist` is True.

    See Also
    --------
    where : Return elements from one of two arrays depending on condition.
    take, choose, compress, diag, diagonal

    Examples
    --------
    Beginning with an array of integers from 0 to 5 (inclusive),
    elements less than ``3`` are negated, elements greater than ``3``
    are squared, and elements not meeting either of these conditions
    (exactly ``3``) are replaced with a `default` value of ``42``.

    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> condlist = [x<3, x>3]
    >>> choicelist = [x, x**2]
    >>> np.select(condlist, choicelist, 42)
    array([ 0,  1,  2, 42, 16, 25])

    When multiple conditions are satisfied, the first one encountered in
    `condlist` is used.

    >>> condlist = [x<=4, x>3]
    >>> choicelist = [x, x**2]
    >>> np.select(condlist, choicelist, 55)
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4, 25])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    Beginning with an array of integers from 0 to 5 (inclusive),
    elements less than ``3`` are negated, elements greater than ``3``
    are squared, and elements not meeting either of these conditions
    (exactly ``3``) are replaced with a `default` value of ``42``.

    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> condlist = [x<3, x>3]
    >>> choicelist = [x, x**2]
    >>> np.select(condlist, choicelist, 42)
    array([ 0,  1,  2, 42, 16, 25])

    When multiple conditions are satisfied, the first one encountered in
    `condlist` is used.

    >>> condlist = [x<=4, x>3]
    >>> choicelist = [x, x**2]
    >>> np.select(condlist, choicelist, 55)
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4, 25])

    Using np.select with a single condition:

    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> condlist = [x > 3]
    >>> choicelist = [x**2]
    >>> np.select(condlist, choicelist, x)
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3, 16, 25])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of `np.select` with a single condition. This is a common use case, and it's helpful to show how the function behaves in this scenario.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of `np.select`, and the additional example provides further clarification on how the function works with a single condition.
