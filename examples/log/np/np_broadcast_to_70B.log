I will provide you with the docstring for the broadcast_to function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.broadcast_to. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Broadcast an array to a new shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : array_like
        The array to broadcast.
    shape : tuple or int
        The shape of the desired array. A single integer ``i`` is interpreted
        as ``(i,)``.
    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
        the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).

    Returns
    -------
    broadcast : array
        A readonly view on the original array with the given shape. It is
        typically not contiguous. Furthermore, more than one element of a
        broadcasted array may refer to a single memory location.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the array is not compatible with the new shape according to NumPy's
        broadcasting rules.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> np.broadcast_to(x, (3, 3))
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [1, 2, 3]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> np.broadcast_to(x, (3, 3))
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [1, 2, 3]])

    Broadcasting a 2D array to a 3D array:
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.broadcast_to(x, (2, 2, 2))
    array([[[1, 2],
             [[1, 2]],
             [[1, 2]]],

           [[[3, 4],
             [[3, 4]],
             [[3, 4]]]])
