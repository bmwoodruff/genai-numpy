I will provide you with the docstring for the flipud function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.flipud. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Reverse the order of elements along axis 0 (up/down).

    For a 2-D array, this flips the entries in each column in the up/down
    direction. Rows are preserved, but appear in a different order than before.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array_like
        A view of `m` with the rows reversed.  Since a view is
        returned, this operation is :math:`\mathcal O(1)`.

    See Also
    --------
    fliplr : Flip array in the left/right direction.
    flip : Flip array in one or more dimensions.
    rot90 : Rotate array counterclockwise.

    Notes
    -----
    Equivalent to ``m[::-1, ...]`` or ``np.flip(m, axis=0)``.
    Requires the array to be at least 1-D.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> A = np.diag([1.0, 2, 3])
    >>> A
    array([[1.,  0.,  0.],
           [0.,  2.,  0.],
           [0.,  0.,  3.]])
    >>> np.flipud(A)
    array([[0.,  0.,  3.],
           [0.,  2.,  0.],
           [1.,  0.,  0.]])

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> A = rng.normal(size=(2,3,5))
    >>> np.all(np.flipud(A) == A[::-1,...])
    True

    >>> np.flipud([1,2])
    array([2, 1])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Reverse the order of elements along axis 0 (up/down).

    For a 2-D array, this flips the entries in each column in the up/down
    direction. Rows are preserved, but appear in a different order than before.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array_like
        A view of `m` with the rows reversed.  Since a view is
        returned, this operation is :math:`\mathcal O(1)`.

    See Also
    --------
    fliplr : Flip array in the left/right direction.
    flip : Flip array in one or more dimensions.
    rot90 : Rotate array counterclockwise.

    Notes
    -----
    Equivalent to ``m[::-1, ...]`` or ``np.flip(m, axis=0)``.
    Requires the array to be at least 1-D.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> A = np.diag([1.0, 2, 3])
    >>> A
    array([[1.,  0.,  0.],
           [0.,  2.,  0.],
           [0.,  0.,  3.]])
    >>> np.flipud(A)
    array([[0.,  0.,  3.],
           [0.,  2.,  0.],
           [1.,  0.,  0.]])

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> A = rng.normal(size=(2,3,5))
    >>> np.all(np.flipud(A) == A[::-1,...])
    True

    >>> np.flipud([1,2])
    array([2, 1])

    Flipping a 1-D array with multiple elements:
    >>> np.flipud([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    array([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])

I decided to add an example to show how `np.flipud` works with a 1-D array that has more than two elements. This example helps to illustrate the behavior of `np.flipud` in a more general case.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including a 2-D array, a 3-D array, and a 1-D array. The additional example I added provides further clarification on the behavior of `np.flipud` with 1-D arrays.
