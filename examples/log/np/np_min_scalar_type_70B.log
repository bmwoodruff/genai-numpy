I will provide you with the docstring for the min_scalar_type function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.min_scalar_type. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    min_scalar_type(a, /)

    For scalar ``a``, returns the data type with the smallest size
    and smallest scalar kind which can hold its value.  For non-scalar
    array ``a``, returns the vector's dtype unmodified.

    Floating point values are not demoted to integers,
    and complex values are not demoted to floats.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : scalar or array_like
        The value whose minimal data type is to be found.

    Returns
    -------
    out : dtype
        The minimal data type.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.min_scalar_type(10)
    dtype('uint8')

    >>> np.min_scalar_type(-260)
    dtype('int16')

    >>> np.min_scalar_type(3.1)
    dtype('float16')

    >>> np.min_scalar_type(1e50)
    dtype('float64')

    >>> np.min_scalar_type(np.arange(4,dtype='f8'))
    dtype('float64')

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    min_scalar_type(a, /)

    For scalar ``a``, returns the data type with the smallest size
    and smallest scalar kind which can hold its value.  For non-scalar
    array ``a``, returns the vector's dtype unmodified.

    Floating point values are not demoted to integers,
    and complex values are not demoted to floats.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : scalar or array_like
        The value whose minimal data type is to be found.

    Returns
    -------
    out : dtype
        The minimal data type.
