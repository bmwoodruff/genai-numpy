You are a helpful assistant working to improve the NumPy documentation. Use numpydoc style guidelines.

I will provide you with the docstring for the empty function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.empty. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

empty(shape, dtype=float, order='C', *, device=None, like=None)

    Return a new array of given shape and type, without initializing entries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : int or tuple of int
        Shape of the empty array, e.g., ``(2, 3)`` or ``2``.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Desired output data-type for the array, e.g, `numpy.int8`. Default is
        `numpy.float64`.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional, default: 'C'
        Whether to store multi-dimensional data in row-major
        (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order in
        memory.
    device : str, optional
        The device on which to place the created array. Default: None.
        For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``"cpu"`` if passed.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of uninitialized (arbitrary) data of the given shape, dtype, and
        order.  Object arrays will be initialized to None.

    See Also
    --------
    empty_like : Return an empty array with shape and type of input.
    ones : Return a new array setting values to one.
    zeros : Return a new array setting values to zero.
    full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike other array creation functions (e.g. `zeros`, `ones`, `full`),
    `empty` does not initialize the values of the array, and may therefore be
    marginally faster. However, the values stored in the newly allocated array
    are arbitrary. For reproducible behavior, be sure to set each element of
    the array before reading.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.empty([2, 2])
    array([[ -9.74499359e+001,   6.69583040e-309],
           [  2.13182611e-314,   3.06959433e-309]])         #uninitialized

    >>> np.empty([2, 2], dtype=int)
    array([[-1073741821, -1067949133],
           [  496041986,    19249760]])                     #uninitialized

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.empty([2, 2])
    array([[ -9.74499359e+001,   6.69583040e-309],
           [  2.13182611e-314,   3.06959433e-309]])         #uninitialized

    >>> np.empty([2, 2], dtype=int)
    array([[-1073741821, -1067949133],
           [  496041986,    19249760]])                     #uninitialized

    Specifying the order:
    >>> np.empty((2, 2), dtype=np.float64, order='F')
    array([[ -1.79769313e+308,   4.94065646e-309],
           [  2.12200346e-314,   5.42101086e-020]])         #uninitialized
