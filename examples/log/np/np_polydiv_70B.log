I will provide you with the docstring for the polydiv function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polydiv. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Returns the quotient and remainder of polynomial division.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    The input arrays are the coefficients (including any coefficients
    equal to zero) of the "numerator" (dividend) and "denominator"
    (divisor) polynomials, respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    u : array_like or poly1d
        Dividend polynomial's coefficients.

    v : array_like or poly1d
        Divisor polynomial's coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    q : ndarray
        Coefficients, including those equal to zero, of the quotient.
    r : ndarray
        Coefficients, including those equal to zero, of the remainder.

    See Also
    --------
    poly, polyadd, polyder, polydiv, polyfit, polyint, polymul, polysub
    polyval

    Notes
    -----
    Both `u` and `v` must be 0-d or 1-d (ndim = 0 or 1), but `u.ndim` need
    not equal `v.ndim`. In other words, all four possible combinations -
    ``u.ndim = v.ndim = 0``, ``u.ndim = v.ndim = 1``,
    ``u.ndim = 1, v.ndim = 0``, and ``u.ndim = 0, v.ndim = 1`` - work.

    Examples
    --------
    .. math:: \frac{3x^2 + 5x + 2}{2x + 1} = 1.5x + 1.75, remainder 0.25

    >>> x = np.array([3.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    >>> y = np.array([2.0, 1.0])
    >>> np.polydiv(x, y)
    (array([1.5 , 1.75]), array([0.25]))

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:
