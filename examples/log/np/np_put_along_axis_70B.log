I will provide you with the docstring for the put_along_axis function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.put_along_axis. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Put values into the destination array by matching 1d index and data slices.

    This iterates over matching 1d slices oriented along the specified axis in
    the index and data arrays, and uses the former to place values into the
    latter. These slices can be different lengths.

    Functions returning an index along an axis, like `argsort` and
    `argpartition`, produce suitable indices for this function.

    .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray (Ni..., M, Nk...)
        Destination array.
    indices : ndarray (Ni..., J, Nk...)
        Indices to change along each 1d slice of `arr`. This must match the
        dimension of arr, but dimensions in Ni and Nj may be 1 to broadcast
        against `arr`.
    values : array_like (Ni..., J, Nk...)
        values to insert at those indices. Its shape and dimension are
        broadcast to match that of `indices`.
    axis : int
        The axis to take 1d slices along. If axis is None, the destination
        array is treated as if a flattened 1d view had been created of it.

    Notes
    -----
    This is equivalent to (but faster than) the following use of `ndindex` and
    `s_`, which sets each of ``ii`` and ``kk`` to a tuple of indices::

        Ni, M, Nk = a.shape[:axis], a.shape[axis], a.shape[axis+1:]
        J = indices.shape[axis]  # Need not equal M

        for ii in ndindex(Ni):
            for kk in ndindex(Nk):
                a_1d       = a      [ii + s_[:,] + kk]
                indices_1d = indices[ii + s_[:,] + kk]
                values_1d  = values [ii + s_[:,] + kk]
                for j in range(J):
                    a_1d[indices_1d[j]] = values_1d[j]

    Equivalently, eliminating the inner loop, the last two lines would be::

                a_1d[indices_1d] = values_1d

    --------
    take_along_axis :
        Take values from the input array by matching 1d index and data slices

    Examples
    --------

    For this sample array

    >>> a = np.array([[10, 30, 20], [60, 40, 50]])

    We can replace the maximum values with:

    >>> ai = np.argmax(a, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    >>> ai
    array([[1],
           [0]])
    >>> np.put_along_axis(a, ai, 99, axis=1)
    >>> a
    array([[10, 99, 20],
           [99, 40, 50]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    For this sample array

    >>> a = np.array([[10, 30, 20], [60, 40, 50]])

    We can replace the maximum values with:

    >>> ai = np.argmax(a, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    >>> ai
    array([[1],
           [0]])
    >>> np.put_along_axis(a, ai, 99, axis=1)
    >>> a
    array([[10, 99, 20],
           [99, 40, 50]])

    Replacing minimum values:

    >>> a = np.array([[10, 30, 20], [60, 40, 50]])
    >>> ai = np.argmin(a, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    >>> ai
    array([[0],
           [1]])
    >>> np.put_along_axis(a, ai, 0, axis=1)
    >>> a
    array([[0, 30, 20],
           [60, 0, 50]])

I decided to add this example because it shows how to replace the minimum values in the array, which is a common use case for `np.put_along_axis`. This example complements the existing example, which replaces the maximum values. By including both examples, users can see how to use `np.put_along_axis` for different types of operations.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic usage of `np.put_along_axis`, and the new example provides additional context for a different use case. The two examples together provide a good understanding of how to use `np.put_along_axis` effectively.
