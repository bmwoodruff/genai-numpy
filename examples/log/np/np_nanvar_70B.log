I will provide you with the docstring for the nanvar function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nanvar. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the variance along the specified axis, while ignoring NaNs.

    Returns the variance of the array elements, a measure of the spread of
    a distribution.  The variance is computed for the flattened array by
    default, otherwise over the specified axis.

    For all-NaN slices or slices with zero degrees of freedom, NaN is
    returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the variance is computed.  The default is to compute
        the variance of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the variance.  For arrays of integer type
        the default is `float64`; for arrays of float types it is the same as
        the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type is cast if
        necessary.
    ddof : {int, float}, optional
        "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
        ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
        elements. By default `ddof` is zero.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the variance. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for
        details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    mean : array_like, optional
        Provide the mean to prevent its recalculation. The mean should have
        a shape as if it was calculated with ``keepdims=True``.
        The axis for the calculation of the mean should be the same as used in
        the call to this var function.

        .. versionadded:: 1.26.0

    correction : {int, float}, optional
        Array API compatible name for the ``ddof`` parameter. Only one of them
        can be provided at the same time.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    variance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the variance,
        otherwise return a reference to the output array. If ddof is >= the
        number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice contains only
        NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    See Also
    --------
    std : Standard deviation
    mean : Average
    var : Variance while not ignoring NaNs
    nanstd, nanmean
    :ref:`ufuncs-output-type`

    Notes
    -----
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
    i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

    The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
    instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite
    population.  ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the
    variance for normally distributed variables.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    For this function to work on sub-classes of ndarray, they must define
    `sum` with the kwarg `keepdims`

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.nanvar(a)
    1.5555555555555554
    >>> np.nanvar(a, axis=0)
    array([1.,  0.])
    >>> np.nanvar(a, axis=1)
    array([0.,  0.25])  # may vary

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.nanvar(a)
    1.5555555555555554
    >>> np.nanvar(a, axis=0)
    array([1.,  0.])
    >>> np.nanvar(a, axis=1)
    array([0.,  0.25])  # may vary
    Computing variance with ddof: 
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.nanvar(a, ddof=1)
