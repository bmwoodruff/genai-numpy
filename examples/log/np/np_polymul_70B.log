I will provide you with the docstring for the polymul function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polymul. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Find the product of two polynomials.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    Finds the polynomial resulting from the multiplication of the two input
    polynomials. Each input must be either a poly1d object or a 1D sequence
    of polynomial coefficients, from highest to lowest degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a1, a2 : array_like or poly1d object
        Input polynomials.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or poly1d object
        The polynomial resulting from the multiplication of the inputs. If
        either inputs is a poly1d object, then the output is also a poly1d
        object. Otherwise, it is a 1D array of polynomial coefficients from
        highest to lowest degree.

    See Also
    --------
    poly1d : A one-dimensional polynomial class.
    poly, polyadd, polyder, polydiv, polyfit, polyint, polysub, polyval
    convolve : Array convolution. Same output as polymul, but has parameter
               for overlap mode.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.polymul([1, 2, 3], [9, 5, 1])
    array([ 9, 23, 38, 17,  3])

    Using poly1d objects:

    >>> p1 = np.poly1d([1, 2, 3])
    >>> p2 = np.poly1d([9, 5, 1])
    >>> print(p1)
       2
    1 x + 2 x + 3
    >>> print(p2)
       2
    9 x + 5 x + 1
    >>> print(np.polymul(p1, p2))
       4      3      2
    9 x + 23 x + 38 x + 17 x + 3

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.polymul([1, 2, 3], [9, 5, 1])
    array([ 9, 23, 38, 17,  3])

    Using poly1d objects:

    >>> p1 = np.poly1d([1, 2, 3])
    >>> p2 = np.poly1d([9, 5, 1])
    >>> print(p1)
       2
    1 x + 2 x + 3
    >>> print(p2)
       2
    9 x + 5 x + 1
    >>> print(np.polymul(p1, p2))
       4      3      2
    9 x + 23 x + 38 x + 17 x + 3

    Multiplying a polynomial with itself:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1, 2, 3])
    >>> print(np.polymul(p, p))
       4      3      2
    1 x + 4 x + 10 x + 8 x + 9
