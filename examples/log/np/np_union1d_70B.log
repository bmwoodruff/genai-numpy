I will provide you with the docstring for the union1d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.union1d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Find the union of two arrays.

    Return the unique, sorted array of values that are in either of the two
    input arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ar1, ar2 : array_like
        Input arrays. They are flattened if they are not already 1D.

    Returns
    -------
    union1d : ndarray
        Unique, sorted union of the input arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.union1d([-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2])
    array([-2, -1,  0,  1,  2])

    To find the union of more than two arrays, use functools.reduce:

    >>> from functools import reduce
    >>> reduce(np.union1d, ([1, 3, 4, 3], [3, 1, 2, 1], [6, 3, 4, 2]))
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.union1d([-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2])
    array([-2, -1,  0,  1,  2])

    To find the union of more than two arrays, use functools.reduce:

    >>> from functools import reduce
    >>> reduce(np.union1d, ([1, 3, 4, 3], [3, 1, 2, 1], [6, 3, 4, 2]))
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])

    Union of arrays with duplicate values:

    >>> np.union1d([1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4, 4])
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])

I decided to add an example to show the behavior of `np.union1d` when the input arrays contain duplicate values. This is a common use case, and it's useful to demonstrate that `np.union1d` removes duplicates from the input arrays.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.union1d` and the case of finding the union of more than two arrays. The additional example I added provides further insight into the behavior of the function, but it's not necessary to add more examples at this point.
