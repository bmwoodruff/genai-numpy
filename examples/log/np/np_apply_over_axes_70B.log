I will provide you with the docstring for the apply_over_axes function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.apply_over_axes. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Apply a function repeatedly over multiple axes.

    `func` is called as `res = func(a, axis)`, where `axis` is the first
    element of `axes`.  The result `res` of the function call must have
    either the same dimensions as `a` or one less dimension.  If `res`
    has one less dimension than `a`, a dimension is inserted before
    `axis`.  The call to `func` is then repeated for each axis in `axes`,
    with `res` as the first argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        This function must take two arguments, `func(a, axis)`.
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axes : array_like
        Axes over which `func` is applied; the elements must be integers.

    Returns
    -------
    apply_over_axis : ndarray
        The output array.  The number of dimensions is the same as `a`,
        but the shape can be different.  This depends on whether `func`
        changes the shape of its output with respect to its input.

    See Also
    --------
    apply_along_axis :
        Apply a function to 1-D slices of an array along the given axis.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is equivalent to tuple axis arguments to reorderable ufuncs
    with keepdims=True. Tuple axis arguments to ufuncs have been available since
    version 1.7.0.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)
    >>> a
    array([[[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
            [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
            [ 8,  9, 10, 11]],
           [[12, 13, 14, 15],
            [16, 17, 18, 19],
            [20, 21, 22, 23]]])

    Sum over axes 0 and 2. The result has same number of dimensions
    as the original array:

    >>> np.apply_over_axes(np.sum, a, [0,2])
    array([[[ 60],
            [ 92],
            [124]]])

    Tuple axis arguments to ufuncs are equivalent:

    >>> np.sum(a, axis=(0,2), keepdims=True)
    array([[[ 60],
            [ 92],
            [124]]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)
    >>> a
    array([[[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
            [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
            [ 8,  9, 10, 11]],
           [[12, 13, 14, 15],
            [16, 17, 18, 19],
            [20, 21, 22, 23]]])

    Sum over axes 0 and 2. The result has same number of dimensions
    as the original array:

    >>> np.apply_over_axes(np.sum, a, [0,2])
    array([[[ 60],
            [ 92],
            [124]]])

    Tuple axis arguments to ufuncs are equivalent:

    >>> np.sum(a, axis=(0,2), keepdims=True)
    array([[[ 60],
            [ 92],
            [124]]])

    Mean over axes 1 and 2. The result has same number of dimensions
    as the original array:

    >>> np.apply_over_axes(np.mean, a, [1,2])
    array([[[  6.],
            [ 18.]]])
