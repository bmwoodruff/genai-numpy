I will provide you with the docstring for the corrcoef function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.corrcoef. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.

    Please refer to the documentation for `cov` for more detail.  The
    relationship between the correlation coefficient matrix, `R`, and the
    covariance matrix, `C`, is

    .. math:: R_{ij} = \frac{ C_{ij} } { \sqrt{ C_{ii} C_{jj} } }

    The values of `R` are between -1 and 1, inclusive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
        Each row of `x` represents a variable, and each column a single
        observation of all those variables. Also see `rowvar` below.
    y : array_like, optional
        An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same
        shape as `x`.
    rowvar : bool, optional
        If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a
        variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship
        is transposed: each column represents a variable, while the rows
        contain observations.
    bias : _NoValue, optional
        Has no effect, do not use.

        .. deprecated:: 1.10.0
    ddof : _NoValue, optional
        Has no effect, do not use.

        .. deprecated:: 1.10.0
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Data-type of the result. By default, the return data-type will have
        at least `numpy.float64` precision.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20

    Returns
    -------
    R : ndarray
        The correlation coefficient matrix of the variables.

    See Also
    --------
    cov : Covariance matrix

    Notes
    -----
    Due to floating point rounding the resulting array may not be Hermitian,
    the diagonal elements may not be 1, and the elements may not satisfy the
    inequality abs(a) <= 1. The real and imaginary parts are clipped to the
    interval [-1,  1] in an attempt to improve on that situation but is not
    much help in the complex case.

    This function accepts but discards arguments `bias` and `ddof`.  This is
    for backwards compatibility with previous versions of this function.  These
    arguments had no effect on the return values of the function and can be
    safely ignored in this and previous versions of numpy.

    Examples
    --------
    In this example we generate two random arrays, ``xarr`` and ``yarr``, and
    compute the row-wise and column-wise Pearson correlation coefficients,
    ``R``. Since ``rowvar`` is  true by  default, we first find the row-wise
    Pearson correlation coefficients between the variables of ``xarr``.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=42)
    >>> xarr = rng.random((3, 3))
    >>> xarr
    array([[0.77395605, 0.43887844, 0.85859792],
           [0.69736803, 0.09417735, 0.97562235],
           [0.7611397 , 0.78606431, 0.12811363]])
    >>> R1 = np.corrcoef(xarr)
    >>> R1
    array([[ 1.        ,  0.99256089, -0.68080986],
           [ 0.99256089,  1.        , -0.76492172],
           [-0.68080986, -0.76492172,  1.        ]])

    If we add another set of variables and observations ``yarr``, we can
    compute the row-wise Pearson correlation coefficients between the
    variables in ``xarr`` and ``yarr``.

    >>> yarr = rng.random((3, 3))
    >>> yarr
    array([[0.45038594, 0.37079802, 0.92676499],
           [0.64386512, 0.82276161, 0.4434142 ],
           [0.22723872, 0.55458479, 0.06381726]])
    >>> R2 = np.corrcoef(xarr, yarr)
    >>> R2
    array([[ 1.        ,  0.99256089, -0.68080986,  0.75008178, -0.934284  ,
            -0.99004057],
           [ 0.99256089,  1.        , -0.76492172,  0.82502011, -0.97074098,
            -0.99981569],
           [-0.68080986, -0.76492172,  1.        , -0.99507202,  0.89721355,
             0.77714685],
           [ 0.75008178,  0.82502011, -0.99507202,  1.        , -0.93657855,
            -0.83571711],
           [-0.934284  , -0.97074098,  0.89721355, -0.93657855,  1.        ,
             0.97517215],
           [-0.99004057, -0.99981569,  0.77714685, -0.83571711,  0.97517215,
             1.        ]])

    Finally if we use the option ``rowvar=False``, the columns are now
    being treated as the variables and we will find the column-wise Pearson
    correlation coefficients between variables in ``xarr`` and ``yarr``.

    >>> R3 = np.corrcoef(xarr, yarr, rowvar=False)
    >>> R3
    array([[ 1.        ,  0.77598074, -0.47458546, -0.75078643, -0.9665554 ,
