I will provide you with the docstring for the cumsum function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.cumsum. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the cumulative sum of the elements along a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default
        (None) is to compute the cumsum over the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults
        to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with a
        precision less than that of the default platform integer.  In
        that case, the default platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type will be cast if necessary. See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type`
        for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    cumsum_along_axis : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case a reference to `out` is returned. The
        result has the same size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if
        `axis` is not None or `a` is a 1-d array.

    See Also
    --------
    sum : Sum array elements.
    trapezoid : Integration of array values using composite trapezoidal rule.
    diff : Calculate the n-th discrete difference along given axis.

    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
    raised on overflow.

    ``cumsum(a)[-1]`` may not be equal to ``sum(a)`` for floating-point
    values since ``sum`` may use a pairwise summation routine, reducing
    the roundoff-error. See `sum` for more information.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.cumsum(a)
    array([ 1,  3,  6, 10, 15, 21])
    >>> np.cumsum(a, dtype=float)     # specifies type of output value(s)
    array([  1.,   3.,   6.,  10.,  15.,  21.])

    >>> np.cumsum(a,axis=0)      # sum over rows for each of the 3 columns
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [5, 7, 9]])
    >>> np.cumsum(a,axis=1)      # sum over columns for each of the 2 rows
    array([[ 1,  3,  6],
           [ 4,  9, 15]])

    ``cumsum(b)[-1]`` may not be equal to ``sum(b)``

    >>> b = np.array([1, 2e-9, 3e-9] * 1000000)
    >>> b.cumsum()[-1]
    1000000.0050045159
    >>> b.sum()
    1000000.0050000029

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.cumsum(a)
    array([ 1,  3,  6, 10, 15, 21])
    >>> np.cumsum(a, dtype=float)     # specifies type of output value(s)
    array([  1.,   3.,   6.,  10.,  15.,  21.])

    >>> np.cumsum(a,axis=0)      # sum over rows for each of the 3 columns
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [5, 7, 9]])
    >>> np.cumsum(a,axis=1)      # sum over columns for each of the 2 rows
    array([[ 1,  3,  6],
           [ 4,  9, 15]])

    ``cumsum(b)[-1]`` may not be equal to ``sum(b)``

    >>> b = np.array([1, 2e-9, 3e-9] * 1000000)
    >>> b.cumsum()[-1]
    1000000.0050045159
    >>> b.sum()
    1000000.0050000029

    Cumulative sum of a 1-D array:
    >>> np.cumsum(np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
    array([ 1,  3,  6, 10, 15])

I decided to add the last example because it shows the simplest case of using `np.cumsum` on a 1-D array, which is a common use case. This example provides a clear and concise demonstration of the function's behavior in this scenario.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including:

* Computing the cumulative sum of a 2-D array
* Specifying the output type
* Computing the cumulative sum along different axes
* Demonstrating the difference between `cumsum` and `sum` for floating-point values

The additional example I provided fills a gap by showing the behavior of `np.cumsum` on a 1-D array, but further examples would likely be redundant or too specific.
