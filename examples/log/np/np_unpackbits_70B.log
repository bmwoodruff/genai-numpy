I will provide you with the docstring for the unpackbits function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.unpackbits. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    unpackbits(a, /, axis=None, count=None, bitorder='big')

    Unpacks elements of a uint8 array into a binary-valued output array.

    Each element of `a` represents a bit-field that should be unpacked
    into a binary-valued output array. The shape of the output array is
    either 1-D (if `axis` is ``None``) or the same shape as the input
    array with unpacking done along the axis specified.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray, uint8 type
       Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        The dimension over which bit-unpacking is done.
        ``None`` implies unpacking the flattened array.
    count : int or None, optional
        The number of elements to unpack along `axis`, provided as a way
        of undoing the effect of packing a size that is not a multiple
        of eight. A non-negative number means to only unpack `count`
        bits. A negative number means to trim off that many bits from
        the end. ``None`` means to unpack the entire array (the
        default). Counts larger than the available number of bits will
        add zero padding to the output. Negative counts must not
        exceed the available number of bits.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17.0

    bitorder : {'big', 'little'}, optional
        The order of the returned bits. 'big' will mimic bin(val),
        ``3 = 0b00000011 => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]``, 'little' will reverse
        the order to ``[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]``.
        Defaults to 'big'.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17.0

    Returns
    -------
    unpacked : ndarray, uint8 type
       The elements are binary-valued (0 or 1).

    See Also
    --------
    packbits : Packs the elements of a binary-valued array into bits in
               a uint8 array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[2], [7], [23]], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> a
    array([[ 2],
           [ 7],
           [23]], dtype=uint8)
    >>> b = np.unpackbits(a, axis=1)
    >>> b
    array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]], dtype=uint8)
    >>> c = np.unpackbits(a, axis=1, count=-3)
    >>> c
    array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]], dtype=uint8)

    >>> p = np.packbits(b, axis=0)
    >>> np.unpackbits(p, axis=0)
    array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=uint8)
    >>> np.array_equal(b, np.unpackbits(p, axis=0, count=b.shape[0]))
    True

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[2], [7], [23]], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> a
    array([[ 2],
           [ 7],
           [23]], dtype=uint8)
    >>> b = np.unpackbits(a, axis=1)
    >>> b
    array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]], dtype=uint8)
    >>> c = np.unpackbits(a, axis=1, count=-3)
    >>> c
    array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0,  0, 0, 1, 0]], dtype=uint8)

    >>> p = np.packbits(b, axis=0)
    >>> np.unpackbits(p, axis=0)
    array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=uint8)
    >>> np.array_equal(b, np.unpackbits(p, axis=0, count=b.shape[0]))
    True

    Unpacking with little-endian bit order:
    >>> a = np.array([1], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.unpackbits(a, bitorder='little')
    array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], dtype=uint8)

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `bitorder` parameter with a value of 'little', which is often used in network byte order. This example shows how the bits are unpacked in little-endian order, which can be useful for users who need to work with data in this format.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of the `unpackbits` function, including unpacking with different axes, counts, and bit orders. The additional example I added provides further clarity on the `bitorder` parameter, but further examples would likely be redundant or too specific to particular use cases.
