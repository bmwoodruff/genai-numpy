I will provide you with the docstring for the common_type function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.common_type. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return a scalar type which is common to the input arrays.

    The return type will always be an inexact (i.e. floating point) scalar
    type, even if all the arrays are integer arrays. If one of the inputs is
    an integer array, the minimum precision type that is returned is a
    64-bit floating point dtype.

    All input arrays except int64 and uint64 can be safely cast to the
    returned dtype without loss of information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array1, array2, ... : ndarrays
        Input arrays.

    Returns
    -------
    out : data type code
        Data type code.

    See Also
    --------
    dtype, mintypecode

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.common_type(np.arange(2, dtype=np.float32))
    <class 'numpy.float32'>
    >>> np.common_type(np.arange(2, dtype=np.float32), np.arange(2))
    <class 'numpy.float64'>
    >>> np.common_type(np.arange(4), np.array([45, 6.j]), np.array([45.0]))
    <class 'numpy.complex128'>

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return a scalar type which is common to the input arrays.

    The return type will always be an inexact (i.e. floating point) scalar
    type, even if all the arrays are integer arrays. If one of the inputs is
    an integer array, the minimum precision type that is returned is a
    64-bit floating point dtype.

    All input arrays except int64 and uint64 can be safely cast to the
    returned dtype without loss of information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array1, array2, ... : ndarrays
        Input arrays.

    Returns
    -------
    out : data type code
        Data type code.

    See Also
    --------
    dtype, mintypecode

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.common_type(np.arange(2, dtype=np.float32))
    <class 'numpy.float32'>
    >>> np.common_type(np.arange(2, dtype=np.float32), np.arange(2))
    <class 'numpy.float64'>
    >>> np.common_type(np.arange(4), np.array([45, 6.j]), np.array([45.0]))
    <class 'numpy.complex128'>
    Mixed integer and float arrays:
    
    >>> np.common_type(np.array([1, 2, 3]), np.array([1., 2., 3.]))
    <class 'numpy.float64'>


I decided to add an example that demonstrates the behavior of `np.common_type` when given a mix of integer and float arrays. This example helps to illustrate how the function handles this specific scenario.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a range of cases, including single arrays, multiple arrays with different dtypes, and arrays with complex numbers. The additional example I added helps to fill a gap in the existing examples, but further examples may not add significant value to the documentation.
