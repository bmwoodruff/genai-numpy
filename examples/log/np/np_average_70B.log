I will provide you with the docstring for the average function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.average. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing data to be averaged. If `a` is not an array, a
        conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to average `a`.  The default,
        `axis=None`, will average over all of the elements of the input array.
        If axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If axis is a tuple of ints, averaging is performed on all of the axes
        specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
        before.
    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each value in
        `a` contributes to the average according to its associated weight.
        The array of weights must be the same shape as `a` if no axis is
        specified, otherwise the weights must have dimensions and shape
        consistent with `a` along the specified axis.
        If `weights=None`, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a
        weight equal to one.
        The calculation is::

            avg = sum(a * weights) / sum(weights)
        
        where the sum is over all included elements.
        The only constraint on the values of `weights` is that `sum(weights)`
        must not be 0.
    returned : bool, optional
        Default is `False`. If `True`, the tuple (`average`, `sum_of_weights`)
        is returned, otherwise only the average is returned.
        If `weights=None`, `sum_of_weights` is equivalent to the number of
        elements over which the average is taken.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.
        *Note:* `keepdims` will not work with instances of `numpy.matrix`
        or other classes whose methods do not support `keepdims`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.23.0

    Returns
    -------
    retval, [sum_of_weights] : array_type or double
        Return the average along the specified axis. When `returned` is `True`,
        return a tuple with the average as the first element and the sum
        of the weights as the second element. `sum_of_weights` is of the
        same type as `retval`. The result dtype follows a general pattern.
        If `weights` is None, the result dtype will be that of `a` , or ``float64``
        if `a` is integral. Otherwise, if `weights` is not None and `a` is non-
        integral, the result type will be the type of lowest precision capable of
        representing values of both `a` and `weights`. If `a` happens to be
        integral, the previous rules still applies but the result dtype will
        at least be ``float64``.

    Raises
    ------
    ZeroDivisionError
        When all weights along axis are zero. See `numpy.ma.average` for a
        version robust to this type of error.
    TypeError
        When `weights` does not have the same shape as `a`, and `axis=None`.
    ValueError
        When `weights` does not have dimensions and shape consistent with `a`
        along specified `axis`.

    See Also
    --------
    mean

    ma.average : average for masked arrays -- useful if your data contains
                 "missing" values
    numpy.result_type : Returns the type that results from applying the
                        numpy type promotion rules to the arguments.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> data = np.arange(1, 5)
    >>> data
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.average(data)
    2.5
    >>> np.average(np.arange(1, 11), weights=np.arange(10, 0, -1))
    4.0

    >>> data = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
    >>> data
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3],
           [4, 5]])
    >>> np.average(data, axis=1, weights=[1./4, 3./4])
    array([0.75, 2.75, 4.75])
    >>> np.average(data, weights=[1./4, 3./4])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: Axis must be specified when shapes of a and weights differ.

    With ``keepdims=True``, the following result has shape (3, 1).

    >>> np.average(data, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[0.5],
           [2.5],
           [4.5]])

    >>> data = np.arange(8).reshape((2, 2, 2))
    >>> data
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],
           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])
    >>> np.average(data, axis=(0, 1), weights=[[1./4, 3./4], [1., 1./2]])
    array([3.4, 4.4])
    >>> np.average(data, axis=0, weights=[[1./4, 3./4], [1., 1./2]])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Shape of weights must be consistent
    with shape of a along specified axis.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> data = np.arange(1, 5)
    >>> data
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.average(data)
    2.5
    >>> np.average(np.arange(1, 11), weights=np.arange(10, 0, -1))
    4.0

    >>> data = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
    >>> data
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3],
           [4, 5]])
    >>> np.average(data, axis=1, weights=[1./4, 3./4])
    array([0.75, 2.75, 4.75])
    >>> np.average(data, weights=[1./4, 3./4])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: Axis must be specified when shapes of a and weights differ.

    With ``keepdims=True``, the following result has shape (3, 1).

    >>> np.average(data, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[0.5],
           [2.5],
           [4.5]])

    >>> data = np.arange(8).reshape((2, 2, 2))
    >>> data
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],
           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])
    >>> np.average(data, axis=(0, 1), weights=[[1./4, 3./4], [1., 1./2]])
    array([3.4, 4.4])
    >>> np.average(data, axis=0, weights=[[1./4, 3./4], [1., 1./2]])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Shape of weights must be consistent
    with shape of a along specified axis.

    Weights with different lengths:
    >>> data = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
    >>> weights = [1./4, 1./2, 3./4]
    >>> np.average(data, axis=0, weights=weights)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Length of weights must be consistent with specified axis.

I decided to add an example that demonstrates the error that occurs when the length of the weights array is not consistent with the specified axis. This example helps to clarify the requirements for the weights array and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the function's behavior.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples, along with the new one, provide a good coverage of the function's features and edge cases. The examples demonstrate the function's behavior with different types of input data, weights, and axes, as well as the errors that occur when the inputs are invalid.
