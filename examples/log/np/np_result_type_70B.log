I will provide you with the docstring for the result_type function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.result_type. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    result_type(*arrays_and_dtypes)

    Returns the type that results from applying the NumPy
    type promotion rules to the arguments.

    Type promotion in NumPy works similarly to the rules in languages
    like C++, with some slight differences.  When both scalars and
    arrays are used, the array's type takes precedence and the actual value
    of the scalar is taken into account.

    For example, calculating 3*a, where a is an array of 32-bit floats,
    intuitively should result in a 32-bit float output.  If the 3 is a
    32-bit integer, the NumPy rules indicate it can't convert losslessly
    into a 32-bit float, so a 64-bit float should be the result type.
    By examining the value of the constant, '3', we see that it fits in
    an 8-bit integer, which can be cast losslessly into the 32-bit float.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays_and_dtypes : list of arrays and dtypes
        The operands of some operation whose result type is needed.

    Returns
    -------
    out : dtype
        The result type.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

    The specific algorithm used is as follows.

    Categories are determined by first checking which of boolean,
    integer (int/uint), or floating point (float/complex) the maximum
    kind of all the arrays and the scalars are.

    If there are only scalars or the maximum category of the scalars
    is higher than the maximum category of the arrays,
    the data types are combined with :func:`promote_types`
    to produce the return value.

    Otherwise, `min_scalar_type` is called on each scalar, and
    the resulting data types are all combined with :func:`promote_types`
    to produce the return value.

    The set of int values is not a subset of the uint values for types
    with the same number of bits, something not reflected in
    :func:`min_scalar_type`, but handled as a special case in `result_type`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.result_type(3, np.arange(7, dtype='i1'))
    dtype('int8')

    >>> np.result_type('i4', 'c8')
    dtype('complex128')

    >>> np.result_type(3.0, -2)
    dtype('float64')

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.result_type(3, np.arange(7, dtype='i1'))
    dtype('int8')

    >>> np.result_type('i4', 'c8')
    dtype('complex128')

    >>> np.result_type(3.0, -2)
    dtype('float64')

    Mixed integer and float array:
    
    >>> np.result_type(np.array([1, 2, 3]), np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))
    dtype('float64')

I decided to add this example because it demonstrates the behavior of `result_type` when given a mix of integer and float arrays. This is a common use case, and the example helps to illustrate how the function handles this situation.

I stopped here because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including scalar-scalar, scalar-array, and dtype-dtype combinations. The additional example I provided helps to fill a gap in the existing examples, but further examples would likely be redundant or cover edge cases that are not particularly instructive.
