I will provide you with the docstring for the can_cast function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.can_cast. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    can_cast(from_, to, casting='safe')

    Returns True if cast between data types can occur according to the
    casting rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    from_ : dtype, dtype specifier, NumPy scalar, or array
        Data type, NumPy scalar, or array to cast from.
    to : dtype or dtype specifier
        Data type to cast to.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur.

        * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
        * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
        * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
        * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
          like float64 to float32, are allowed.
        * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.

    Returns
    -------
    out : bool
        True if cast can occur according to the casting rule.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionchanged:: 1.17.0
       Casting between a simple data type and a structured one is possible only
       for "unsafe" casting.  Casting to multiple fields is allowed, but
       casting from multiple fields is not.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.9.0
       Casting from numeric to string types in 'safe' casting mode requires
       that the string dtype length is long enough to store the maximum
       integer/float value converted.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
       This function does not support Python scalars anymore and does not
       apply any value-based logic for 0-D arrays and NumPy scalars.

    Basic examples

    >>> np.can_cast(np.int32, np.int64)
    True
    >>> np.can_cast(np.float64, complex)
    True
    >>> np.can_cast(complex, float)
    False

    >>> np.can_cast('i8', 'f8')
    True
    >>> np.can_cast('i8', 'f4')
    False
    >>> np.can_cast('i4', 'S4')
    False

Here is the updated docstring with additional examples:

    Examples
    --------
    Basic examples

    >>> np.can_cast(np.int32, np.int64)
    True
    >>> np.can_cast(np.float64, complex)
    True
    >>> np.can_cast(complex, float)
    False

    >>> np.can_cast('i8', 'f8')
    True
    >>> np.can_cast('i8', 'f4')
    False
    >>> np.can_cast('i4', 'S4')
    False

    Casting with different casting rules:

    >>> np.can_cast(np.int32, np.int64, casting='no')
    False
    >>> np.can_cast(np.int32, np.int64, casting='equiv')
    True
    >>> np.can_cast(np.int32, np.int64, casting='same_kind')
    True
    >>> np.can_cast(np.int32, np.int64, casting='unsafe')
    True

I decided to add these examples because they demonstrate the use of the `casting` parameter, which is an important aspect of the `can_cast` function. The original examples only showed the default behavior with the 'safe' casting rule, but the additional examples show how the function behaves with different casting rules.

I stopped adding examples because the new examples cover the main use cases of the `can_cast` function, including the use of different casting rules. The function is relatively simple, and the existing examples, along with the new ones, provide a comprehensive understanding of its behavior.
