I will provide you with the docstring for the setxor1d function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.setxor1d. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Find the set exclusive-or of two arrays.

    Return the sorted, unique values that are in only one (not both) of the
    input arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ar1, ar2 : array_like
        Input arrays.
    assume_unique : bool
        If True, the input arrays are both assumed to be unique, which
        can speed up the calculation. Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    setxor1d : ndarray
        Sorted 1D array of unique values that are in only one of the input
        arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    >>> b = np.array([2, 3, 5, 7, 5])
    >>> np.setxor1d(a,b)
    array([1, 4, 5, 7])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Find the set exclusive-or of two arrays.

    Return the sorted, unique values that are in only one (not both) of the
    input arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ar1, ar2 : array_like
        Input arrays.
    assume_unique : bool
        If True, the input arrays are both assumed to be unique, which
        can speed up the calculation. Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    setxor1d : ndarray
        Sorted 1D array of unique values that are in only one of the input
        arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    >>> b = np.array([2, 3, 5, 7, 5])
    >>> np.setxor1d(a,b)
    array([1, 4, 5, 7])

    Duplicate values in one array:
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> b = np.array([2, 3, 5, 7, 5])
    >>> np.setxor1d(a,b)
    array([1, 4, 5, 7])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how the function handles duplicate values in one of the input arrays. This is an important edge case that users may encounter, and including an example helps to clarify the behavior of the function in this situation.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic functionality of the function, and the additional example covers a specific edge case. Further examples may be redundant or unnecessary, and may clutter the documentation.
