I will provide you with the docstring for the sort function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.sort. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return a sorted copy of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to be sorted.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which to sort. If None, the array is flattened before
        sorting. The default is -1, which sorts along the last axis.
    kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
        Sorting algorithm. The default is 'quicksort'. Note that both 'stable'
        and 'mergesort' use timsort or radix sort under the covers and,
        in general, the actual implementation will vary with data type.
        The 'mergesort' option is retained for backwards compatibility.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0.
           The 'stable' option was added.

    order : str or list of str, optional
        When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
        which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single field can
        be specified as a string, and not all fields need be specified,
        but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
        they come up in the dtype, to break ties.
    stable : bool, optional
        Sort stability. If ``True``, the returned array will maintain
        the relative order of ``a`` values which compare as equal.
        If ``False`` or ``None``, this is not guaranteed. Internally,
        this option selects ``kind='stable'``. Default: ``None``.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    sorted_array : ndarray
        Array of the same type and shape as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.sort : Method to sort an array in-place.
    argsort : Indirect sort.
    lexsort : Indirect stable sort on multiple keys.
    searchsorted : Find elements in a sorted array.
    partition : Partial sort.

    Notes
    -----
    The various sorting algorithms are characterized by their average speed,
    worst case performance, work space size, and whether they are stable. A
    stable sort keeps items with the same key in the same relative
    order. The four algorithms implemented in NumPy have the following
    properties:

    =========== ======= ============= ============ ========
       kind      speed   worst case    work space   stable
    =========== ======= ============= ============ ========
    'quicksort'    1     O(n^2)            0          no
    'heapsort'     3     O(n*log(n))       0          no
    'mergesort'    2     O(n*log(n))      ~n/2        yes
    'timsort'      2     O(n*log(n))      ~n/2        yes
    =========== ======= ============= ============ ========

    .. note:: The datatype determines which of 'mergesort' or 'timsort'
       is actually used, even if 'mergesort' is specified. User selection
       at a finer scale is not currently available.

    For performance, ``sort`` makes a temporary copy if needed to make the data
    `contiguous <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/glossary.html#term-contiguous>`_
    in memory along the sort axis. For even better performance and reduced
    memory consumption, ensure that the array is already contiguous along the
    sort axis.

    The sort order for complex numbers is lexicographic. If both the real
    and imaginary parts are non-nan then the order is determined by the
    real parts except when they are equal, in which case the order is
    determined by the imaginary parts.

    Previous to numpy 1.4.0 sorting real and complex arrays containing nan
    values led to undefined behaviour. In numpy versions >= 1.4.0 nan
    values are sorted to the end. The extended sort order is:

      * Real: [R, nan]
      * Complex: [R + Rj, R + nanj, nan + Rj, nan + nanj]

    where R is a non-nan real value. Complex values with the same nan
    placements are sorted according to the non-nan part if it exists.
    Non-nan values are sorted as before.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    quicksort has been changed to:
    `introsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort>`_.
    When sorting does not make enough progress it switches to
    `heapsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort>`_.
    This implementation makes quicksort O(n*log(n)) in the worst case.

    'stable' automatically chooses the best stable sorting algorithm
    for the data type being sorted.
    It, along with 'mergesort' is currently mapped to
    `timsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort>`_
    or `radix sort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort>`_
    depending on the data type.
    API forward compatibility currently limits the
    ability to select the implementation and it is hardwired for the different
    data types.

    .. versionadded:: 1.17.0

    Timsort is added for better performance on already or nearly
    sorted data. On random data timsort is almost identical to
    mergesort. It is now used for stable sort while quicksort is still the
    default sort if none is chosen. For timsort details, refer to
    `CPython listsort.txt
    <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/listsort.txt>`_
    'mergesort' and 'stable' are mapped to radix sort for integer data types.
    Radix sort is an O(n) sort instead of O(n log n).

    .. versionchanged:: 1.18.0

    NaT now sorts to the end of arrays for consistency with NaN.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,4],[3,1]])
    >>> np.sort(a)                # sort along the last axis
    array([[1, 4],
           [1, 3]])
    >>> np.sort(a, axis=None)     # sort the flattened array
    array([1, 1, 3, 4])
    >>> np.sort(a, axis=0)        # sort along the first axis
    array([[1, 1],
           [3, 4]])

    Use the `order` keyword to specify a field to use when sorting a
    structured array:

    >>> dtype = [('name', 'S10'), ('height', float), ('age', int)]
    >>> values = [('Arthur', 1.8, 41), ('Lancelot', 1.9, 38),
    ...           ('Galahad', 1.7, 38)]
    >>> a = np.array(values, dtype=dtype)       # create a structured array
    >>> np.sort(a, order='height')                        # doctest: +SKIP
    array([('Galahad', 1.7, 38), ('Arthur', 1.8, 41),
           ('Lancelot', 1.8999999999999999, 38)],
          dtype=[('name', '|S10'), ('height', '<f8'), ('age', '<i4')])

    Sort by age, then height if ages are equal:

    >>> np.sort(a, order=['age', 'height'])               # doctest: +SKIP
    array([('Galahad', 1.7, 38), ('Lancelot', 1.8999999999999999, 38),
           ('Arthur', 1.8, 41)],
          dtype=[('name', '|S10'), ('height', '<f8'), ('age', '<i4')])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,4],[3,1]])
    >>> np.sort(a)                # sort along the last axis
    array([[1, 4],
           [1, 3]])
    >>> np.sort(a, axis=None)     # sort the flattened array
    array([1, 1, 3, 4])
    >>> np.sort(a, axis=0)        # sort along the first axis
    array([[1, 1],
           [3, 4]])

    Use the `order` keyword to specify a field to use when sorting a
    structured array:

    >>> dtype = [('name', 'S10'), ('height', float), ('age', int)]
    >>> values = [('Arthur', 1.8, 41), ('Lancelot', 1.9, 38),
    ...           ('Galahad', 1.7, 38)]
    >>> a = np.array(values, dtype=dtype)       # create a structured array
    >>> np.sort(a, order='height')                        # doctest: +SKIP
    array([('Galahad', 1.7, 38), ('Arthur', 1.8, 41),
           ('Lancelot', 1.8999999999999999, 38)],
          dtype=[('name', '|S10'), ('height', '<f8'), ('age', '<i4')])

    Sort by age, then height if ages are equal:

    >>> np.sort(a, order=['age', 'height'])               # doctest: +SKIP
    array([('Galahad', 1.7, 38), ('Lancelot', 1.8999999999999999, 38),
           ('Arthur', 1.8, 41)],
          dtype=[('name', '|S10'), ('height', '<f8'), ('age', '<i4')])

    Sorting complex numbers:

    >>> a = np.array([1 + 2j, 3 + 4j, 2 + 1j])
    >>> np.sort(a)
    array([1.+2.j, 2.+1.j, 3.+4.j])

I decided to add an example for sorting complex numbers because the docstring mentions that the sort order for complex numbers is lexicographic, but it doesn't provide an example to illustrate this. This example helps to clarify how complex numbers are sorted.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples cover the main use cases of the `sort` function, such as sorting along different axes, using the `order` keyword for structured arrays, and sorting complex numbers. Additional examples would likely be redundant or too specific to be useful for most users.
