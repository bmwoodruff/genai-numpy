I will provide you with the docstring for the log2 function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.log2. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

log2(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Base-2 logarithm of `x`.

Parameters
----------
x : array_like
    Input values.
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray
    Base-2 logarithm of `x`.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

--------
log, log10, log1p, emath.log2

Notes

.. versionadded:: 1.3.0

Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite
number of `z` such that `2**z = x`. The convention is to return the `z`
whose imaginary part lies in `(-pi, pi]`.

For real-valued input data types, `log2` always returns real output.
For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity,
it yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

For complex-valued input, `log2` is a complex analytical function that
has a branch cut `[-inf, 0]` and is continuous from above on it. `log2`
handles the floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal negative
number, conforming to the C99 standard.

In the cases where the input has a negative real part and a very small
negative complex part (approaching 0), the result is so close to `-pi`
that it evaluates to exactly `-pi`.

Examples
--------
>>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 2**4])
>>> np.log2(x)
array([-inf,   0.,   1.,   4.])

>>> xi = np.array([0+1.j, 1, 2+0.j, 4.j])
>>> np.log2(xi)
array([ 0.+2.26618007j,  0.+0.j        ,  1.+0.j        ,  2.+2.26618007j])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 2**4])
>>> np.log2(x)
array([-inf,   0.,   1.,   4.])

>>> xi = np.array([0+1.j, 1, 2+0.j, 4.j])
>>> np.log2(xi)
array([ 0.+2.26618007j,  0.+0.j        ,  1.+0.j        ,  2.+2.26618007j])

Logarithm of a scalar:
>>> np.log2(4)
2.0

I decided to add the third example because it shows the behavior of `np.log2` when given a scalar input, which is not explicitly demonstrated in the existing examples. This example helps to clarify the behavior of the function in a simple case.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already demonstrate the behavior of `np.log2` with both real and complex input arrays, and the new example covers the scalar input case. The documentation already provides a thorough explanation of the function's behavior, and additional examples would likely be redundant or focus on edge cases that are already addressed in the notes section.
