I will provide you with the docstring for the argmin function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.argmin. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Returns the indices of the minimum values along an axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        By default, the index is into the flattened array, otherwise
        along the specified axis.
    out : array, optional
        If provided, the result will be inserted into this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and dtype.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : ndarray of ints
        Array of indices into the array. It has the same shape as `a.shape`
        with the dimension along `axis` removed. If `keepdims` is set to True,
        then the size of `axis` will be 1 with the resulting array having same
        shape as `a.shape`.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.argmin, argmax
    amin : The minimum value along a given axis.
    unravel_index : Convert a flat index into an index tuple.
    take_along_axis : Apply ``np.expand_dims(index_array, axis)``
                      from argmin to an array as if by calling min.

    Notes
    -----
    In case of multiple occurrences of the minimum values, the indices
    corresponding to the first occurrence are returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3) + 10
    >>> a
    array([[10, 11, 12],
           [13, 14, 15]])
    >>> np.argmin(a)
    0
    >>> np.argmin(a, axis=0)
    array([0, 0, 0])
    >>> np.argmin(a, axis=1)
    array([0, 0])

    Indices of the minimum elements of a N-dimensional array:

    >>> ind = np.unravel_index(np.argmin(a, axis=None), a.shape)
    >>> ind
    (0, 0)
    >>> a[ind]
    10

    >>> b = np.arange(6) + 10
    >>> b[4] = 10
    >>> b
    array([10, 11, 12, 13, 10, 15])
    >>> np.argmin(b)  # Only the first occurrence is returned.
    0

    >>> x = np.array([[4,2,3], [1,0,3]])
    >>> index_array = np.argmin(x, axis=-1)
    >>> # Same as np.amin(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    >>> np.take_along_axis(x, np.expand_dims(index_array, axis=-1), axis=-1)
    array([[2],
           [0]])
    >>> # Same as np.amax(x, axis=-1)
    >>> np.take_along_axis(x, np.expand_dims(index_array, axis=-1),
    ...     axis=-1).squeeze(axis=-1)
    array([2, 0])

    Setting `keepdims` to `True`,

    >>> x = np.arange(24).reshape((2, 3, 4))
    >>> res = np.argmin(x, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    >>> res.shape
    (2, 1, 4)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3) + 10
    >>> a
    array([[10, 11, 12],
           [13, 14, 15]])
    >>> np.argmin(a)
    0
    >>> np.argmin(a, axis=0)
    array([0, 0, 0])
    >>> np.argmin(a, axis=1)
    array([0, 0])

    Indices of the minimum elements of a N-dimensional array:

    >>> ind = np.unravel_index(np.argmin(a, axis=None), a.shape)
    >>> ind
    (0, 0)
    >>> a[ind]
    10

    >>> b = np.arange(6) + 10
    >>> b[4] = 10
    >>> b
    array([10, 11, 12, 13, 10, 15])
    >>> np.argmin(b)  # Only the first occurrence is returned.
    0

    >>> x = np.array([[4,2,3], [1,0,3]])
    >>> index_array = np.argmin(x, axis=-1)
    >>> # Same as np.amin(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    >>> np.take_along_axis(x, np.expand_dims(index_array, axis=-1), axis=-1)
    array([[2],
           [0]])
    >>> # Same as np.amax(x, axis=-1)
    >>> np.take_along_axis(x, np.expand_dims(index_array, axis=-1),
    ...     axis=-1).squeeze(axis=-1)
    array([2, 0])

    Setting `keepdims` to `True`,

    >>> x = np.arange(24).reshape((2, 3, 4))
    >>> res = np.argmin(x, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    >>> res.shape
    (2, 1, 4)

    Using argmin with a 1D array:

    >>> c = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
    >>> np.argmin(c)
    0
