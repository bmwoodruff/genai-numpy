I will provide you with the docstring for the mean function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.mean. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.

    Returns the average of the array elements.  The average is taken over
    the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
    `float64` intermediate and return values are used for integer inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose mean is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which the means are computed. The default is to
        compute the mean of the flattened array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a mean is performed over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the mean.  For integer inputs, the default
        is `float64`; for floating point inputs, it is the same as the
        input dtype.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.
        See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.
        See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `mean` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the mean. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    m : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out=None`, returns a new array containing the mean values,
        otherwise a reference to the output array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    average : Weighted average
    std, var, nanmean, nanstd, nanvar

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided
    by the number of elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the
    same precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can
    cause the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see
    example below).  Specifying a higher-precision accumulator using the
    `dtype` keyword can alleviate this issue.

    By default, `float16` results are computed using `float32` intermediates
    for extra precision.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.mean(a)
    2.5
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=0)
    array([2., 3.])
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=1)
    array([1.5, 3.5])

    In single precision, `mean` can be inaccurate:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0
    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1
    >>> np.mean(a)
    0.54999924

    Computing the mean in float64 is more accurate:

    >>> np.mean(a, dtype=np.float64)
    0.55000000074505806 # may vary

    Specifying a where argument:

    >>> a = np.array([[5, 9, 13], [14, 10, 12], [11, 15, 19]])
    >>> np.mean(a)
    12.0
    >>> np.mean(a, where=[[True], [False], [False]])
    9.0

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.mean(a)
    2.5
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=0)
    array([2., 3.])
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=1)
    array([1.5, 3.5])

    In single precision, `mean` can be inaccurate:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0
    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1
    >>> np.mean(a)
    0.54999924

    Computing the mean in float64 is more accurate:

    >>> np.mean(a, dtype=np.float64)
    0.55000000074505806 # may vary

    Specifying a where argument:

    >>> a = np.array([[5, 9, 13], [14, 10, 12], [11, 15, 19]])
    >>> np.mean(a)
    12.0
    >>> np.mean(a, where=[[True], [False], [False]])
    9.0

    Using keepdims:

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    array([[2.5]])
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[1.5], [3.5]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `keepdims` parameter, which is an important feature of the `mean` function. This example shows how `keepdims` affects the shape of the output array.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of the `mean` function, including computing the mean of a 2D array, specifying an axis, dealing with inaccurate results in single precision, and using the `where` argument. The additional example I provided demonstrates the use of `keepdims`, which is an important aspect of the function's behavior.
