I will provide you with the docstring for the frombuffer function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.frombuffer. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

frombuffer(buffer, dtype=float, count=-1, offset=0, *, like=None)

    Interpret a buffer as a 1-dimensional array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    buffer : buffer_like
        An object that exposes the buffer interface.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Data-type of the returned array; default: float.
    count : int, optional
        Number of items to read. ``-1`` means all data in the buffer.
    offset : int, optional
        Start reading the buffer from this offset (in bytes); default: 0.
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray

    See also
    --------
    ndarray.tobytes
        Inverse of this operation, construct Python bytes from the raw data
        bytes in the array.

    Notes
    -----
    If the buffer has data that is not in machine byte-order, this should
    be specified as part of the data-type, e.g.::

      >>> dt = np.dtype(int)
      >>> dt = dt.newbyteorder('>')
      >>> np.frombuffer(buf, dtype=dt) # doctest: +SKIP

    The data of the resulting array will not be byteswapped, but will be
    interpreted correctly.

    This function creates a view into the original object.  This should be safe
    in general, but it may make sense to copy the result when the original
    object is mutable or untrusted.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> s = b'hello world'
    >>> np.frombuffer(s, dtype='S1', count=5, offset=6)
    array([b'w', b'o', b'r', b'l', b'd'], dtype='|S1')

    >>> np.frombuffer(b'\x01\x02', dtype=np.uint8)
    array([1, 2], dtype=uint8)
    >>> np.frombuffer(b'\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05', dtype=np.uint8, count=3)
    array([1, 2, 3], dtype=uint8)

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> s = b'hello world'
    >>> np.frombuffer(s, dtype='S1', count=5, offset=6)
    array([b'w', b'o', b'r', b'l', b'd'], dtype='|S1')

    >>> np.frombuffer(b'\x01\x02', dtype=np.uint8)
    array([1, 2], dtype=uint8)
    >>> np.frombuffer(b'\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05', dtype=np.uint8, count=3)
    array([1, 2, 3], dtype=uint8)

    Using frombuffer with a custom dtype:
    
    >>> dt = np.dtype([('x', np.int8), ('y', np.int8)])
    >>> buf = b'\x01\x02\x03\x04'
    >>> np.frombuffer(buf, dtype=dt)
    array([(1, 2), (3, 4)], dtype=[('x', 'i1'), ('y', 'i1')])

I decided to add an example that demonstrates the use of `frombuffer` with a custom dtype, specifically a structured dtype. This example shows how to create a buffer with data that matches the custom dtype, and then use `frombuffer` to interpret the buffer as an array with that dtype.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `frombuffer` with different dtypes and count/offset parameters. The additional example I provided fills a gap in the documentation by showing how to use `frombuffer` with a custom dtype, which can be a useful and powerful feature for users who need to work with complex data structures.
