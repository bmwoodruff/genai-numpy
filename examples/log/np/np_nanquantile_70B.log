I will provide you with the docstring for the nanquantile function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nanquantile. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the qth quantile of the data along the specified axis,
    while ignoring nan values.
    Returns the qth quantile(s) of the array elements.

    .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array, containing
        nan values to be ignored
    q : array_like of float
        Probability or sequence of probabilities for the quantiles to compute.
        Values must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the quantiles are computed. The
        default is to compute the quantile(s) along a flattened
        version of the array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by intermediate
        calculations, to save memory. In this case, the contents of the input
        `a` after this function completes is undefined.
    method : str, optional
        This parameter specifies the method to use for estimating the
        quantile.  There are many different methods, some unique to NumPy.
        See the notes for explanation.  The options sorted by their R type
        as summarized in the H&F paper [1]_ are:

        1. 'inverted_cdf'
        2. 'averaged_inverted_cdf'
        3. 'closest_observation'
        4. 'interpolated_inverted_cdf'
        5. 'hazen'
        6. 'weibull'
        7. 'linear'  (default)
        8. 'median_unbiased'
        9. 'normal_unbiased'

        The first three methods are discontinuous.  NumPy further defines the
        following discontinuous variations of the default 'linear' (7.) option:

        * 'lower'
        * 'higher',
        * 'midpoint'
        * 'nearest'

        .. versionchanged:: 1.22.0
            This argument was previously called "interpolation" and only
            offered the "linear" default and last four options.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

        If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
        through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
        `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each value in
        `a` contributes to the quantile according to its associated weight.
        The weights array can either be 1-D (in which case its length must be
        the size of `a` along the given axis) or of the same shape as `a`.
        If `weights=None`, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a
        weight equal to one.
        Only `method="inverted_cdf"` supports weights.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    interpolation : str, optional
        Deprecated name for the method keyword argument.

        .. deprecated:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    quantile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single probability and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple probability levels are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the quantiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    quantile
    nanmean, nanmedian
    nanmedian : equivalent to ``nanquantile(..., 0.5)``
    nanpercentile : same as nanquantile, but with q in the range [0, 100].

    Notes
    -----
    The behavior of `numpy.nanquantile` is the same as that of
    `numpy.quantile` (ignoring nan values).
    For more information, please see `numpy.quantile`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10., 7., 4.], [3., 2., 1.]])
    >>> a[0][1] = np.nan
    >>> a
    array([[10.,  nan,   4.],
          [ 3.,   2.,   1.]])
    >>> np.quantile(a, 0.5)
    np.float64(nan)
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5)
    3.0
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=0)
    array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[7.],
           [2.]])
    >>> m = np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=0)
    >>> out = np.zeros_like(m)
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=0, out=out)
    array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
    >>> m
    array([6.5,  2. ,  2.5])
    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanquantile(b, 0.5, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([7., 2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10., 7., 4.], [3., 2., 1.]])
    >>> a[0][1] = np.nan
    >>> a
    array([[10.,  nan,   4.],
          [ 3.,   2.,   1.]])
    >>> np.quantile(a, 0.5)
    np.float64(nan)
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5)
    3.0
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=0)
    array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[7.],
           [2.]])
    >>> m = np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=0)
    >>> out = np.zeros_like(m)
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, 0.5, axis=0, out=out)
    array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
    >>> m
    array([6.5,  2. ,  2.5])
    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanquantile(b, 0.5, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([7., 2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)

    Multiple quantiles:
    >>> np.nanquantile(a, [0.25, 0.5, 0.75])
    array([2.5, 3. , 4.5])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how to compute multiple quantiles at once, as this is a common use case for the `nanquantile` function. This example shows how to pass a list of probabilities to compute multiple quantiles in a single call.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a wide range of use cases, including computing the median, computing quantiles along different axes, using the `keepdims` and `out` parameters, and demonstrating the difference between `nanquantile` and `quantile`. The additional example I added provides further illustration of the function's capabilities, but it is not necessary to add more examples to fully understand the function's behavior.
