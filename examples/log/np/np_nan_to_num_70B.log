You are a helpful assistant working to improve the NumPy documentation. Use numpydoc style guidelines.

I will provide you with the docstring for the nan_to_num function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nan_to_num. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Replace NaN with zero and infinity with large finite numbers (default
    behaviour) or with the numbers defined by the user using the `nan`,
    `posinf` and/or `neginf` keywords.

    If `x` is inexact, NaN is replaced by zero or by the user defined value in
    `nan` keyword, infinity is replaced by the largest finite floating point
    values representable by ``x.dtype`` or by the user defined value in
    `posinf` keyword and -infinity is replaced by the most negative finite
    floating point values representable by ``x.dtype`` or by the user defined
    value in `neginf` keyword.

    For complex dtypes, the above is applied to each of the real and
    imaginary components of `x` separately.

    If `x` is not inexact, then no replacements are made.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : scalar or array_like
        Input data.
    copy : bool, optional
        Whether to create a copy of `x` (True) or to replace values
        in-place (False). The in-place operation only occurs if
        casting to an array does not require a copy.
        Default is True.

        .. versionadded:: 1.13
    nan : int, float, optional
        Value to be used to fill NaN values. If no value is passed
        then NaN values will be replaced with 0.0.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17
    posinf : int, float, optional
        Value to be used to fill positive infinity values. If no value is
        passed then positive infinity values will be replaced with a very
        large number.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17
    neginf : int, float, optional
        Value to be used to fill negative infinity values. If no value is
        passed then negative infinity values will be replaced with a very
        small (or negative) number.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17



    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        `x`, with the non-finite values replaced. If `copy` is False, this may
        be `x` itself.

    See Also
    --------
    isinf : Shows which elements are positive or negative infinity.
    isneginf : Shows which elements are negative infinity.
    isposinf : Shows which elements are positive infinity.
    isnan : Shows which elements are Not a Number (NaN).
    isfinite : Shows which elements are finite (not NaN, not infinity)

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
