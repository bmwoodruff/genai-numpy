I will provide you with the docstring for the fmod function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fmod. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

fmod(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Returns the element-wise remainder of division.

This is the NumPy implementation of the C library function fmod, the
remainder has the same sign as the dividend `x1`. It is equivalent to
the Matlab(TM) ``rem`` function and should not be confused with the
Python modulus operator ``x1 % x2``.

Parameters
----------
x1 : array_like
    Dividend.
x2 : array_like
    Divisor.
    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : array_like
    The remainder of the division of `x1` by `x2`.
    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

See Also
--------
remainder : Equivalent to the Python ``%`` operator.
divide

Notes
-----
The result of the modulo operation for negative dividend and divisors
is bound by conventions. For `fmod`, the sign of result is the sign of
the dividend, while for `remainder` the sign of the result is the sign
of the divisor. The `fmod` function is equivalent to the Matlab(TM)
``rem`` function.

Examples
--------
>>> np.fmod([-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3], 2)
array([-1,  0, -1,  1,  0,  1])
>>> np.remainder([-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3], 2)
array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])

>>> np.fmod([5, 3], [2, 2.])
array([ 1.,  1.])
>>> a = np.arange(-3, 3).reshape(3, 2)
>>> a
array([[-3, -2],
       [-1,  0],
       [ 1,  2]])
>>> np.fmod(a, [2,2])
array([[-1,  0],
       [-1,  0],
       [ 1,  0]])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.fmod([-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3], 2)
array([-1,  0, -1,  1,  0,  1])
>>> np.remainder([-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3], 2)
array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1])

>>> np.fmod([5, 3], [2, 2.])
array([ 1.,  1.])
>>> a = np.arange(-3, 3).reshape(3, 2)
>>> a
array([[-3, -2],
       [-1,  0],
       [ 1,  2]])
>>> np.fmod(a, [2,2])
array([[-1,  0],
       [-1,  0],
       [ 1,  0]])

Floating point dividend and divisor:
>>> np.fmod([1.5, 2.5, 3.5], 2.5)
array([ 1. ,  0. ,  1. ])

I decided to add an example that demonstrates the use of floating point numbers as both the dividend and divisor. This is because the existing examples only show integer dividends and divisors, and it's important to illustrate how the function behaves with floating point numbers.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including negative and positive integers, broadcasting, and scalar inputs. The additional example I added provides further insight into the function's behavior with floating point numbers, and I believe that's sufficient to illustrate the function's capabilities.
