I will provide you with the docstring for the isrealobj function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.isrealobj. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return True if x is a not complex type or an array of complex numbers.

    The type of the input is checked, not the value. So even if the input
    has an imaginary part equal to zero, `isrealobj` evaluates to False
    if the data type is complex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : any
        The input can be of any type and shape.

    Returns
    -------
    y : bool
        The return value, False if `x` is of a complex type.

    See Also
    --------
    iscomplexobj, isreal

    Notes
    -----
    The function is only meant for arrays with numerical values but it
    accepts all other objects. Since it assumes array input, the return
    value of other objects may be True.

    >>> np.isrealobj('A string')
    True
    >>> np.isrealobj(False)
    True
    >>> np.isrealobj(None)
    True

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.isrealobj(1)
    True
    >>> np.isrealobj(1+0j)
    False
    >>> np.isrealobj([3, 1+0j, True])
    False

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return True if x is a not complex type or an array of complex numbers.

    The type of the input is checked, not the value. So even if the input
    has an imaginary part equal to zero, `isrealobj` evaluates to False
    if the data type is complex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : any
        The input can be of any type and shape.

    Returns
    -------
    y : bool
        The return value, False if `x` is of a complex type.

    Notes

    The function is only meant for arrays with numerical values but it
    accepts all other objects. Since it assumes array input, the return
    value of other objects may be True.

    >>> np.isrealobj('A string')
    True
    >>> np.isrealobj(False)
    True
    >>> np.isrealobj(None)
    True

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.isrealobj(1)
    True
    >>> np.isrealobj(1+0j)
    False
    >>> np.isrealobj([3, 1+0j, True])
    False
    Array with mixed types:
    
    >>> np.isrealobj([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    True
