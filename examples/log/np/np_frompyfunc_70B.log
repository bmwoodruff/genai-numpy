I will provide you with the docstring for the frompyfunc function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.frompyfunc. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

frompyfunc(func, /, nin, nout, *[, identity])

    Takes an arbitrary Python function and returns a NumPy ufunc.

    Can be used, for example, to add broadcasting to a built-in Python
    function (see Examples section).

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : Python function object
        An arbitrary Python function.
    nin : int
        The number of input arguments.
    nout : int
        The number of objects returned by `func`.
    identity : object, optional
        The value to use for the `~numpy.ufunc.identity` attribute of the resulting
        object. If specified, this is equivalent to setting the underlying
        C ``identity`` field to ``PyUFunc_IdentityValue``.
        If omitted, the identity is set to ``PyUFunc_None``. Note that this is
        _not_ equivalent to setting the identity to ``None``, which implies the
        operation is reorderable.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ufunc
        Returns a NumPy universal function (``ufunc``) object.

    See Also
    --------
    vectorize : Evaluates pyfunc over input arrays using broadcasting rules of numpy.

    Notes
    -----
    The returned ufunc always returns PyObject arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    Use frompyfunc to add broadcasting to the Python function ``oct``:

    >>> oct_array = np.frompyfunc(oct, 1, 1)
    >>> oct_array(np.array((10, 30, 100)))
    array(['0o12', '0o36', '0o144'], dtype=object)
    >>> np.array((oct(10), oct(30), oct(100))) # for comparison
    array(['0o12', '0o36', '0o144'], dtype='<U5')

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    Use frompyfunc to add broadcasting to the Python function ``oct``:

    >>> oct_array = np.frompyfunc(oct, 1, 1)
    >>> oct_array(np.array((10, 30, 100)))
    array(['0o12', '0o36', '0o144'], dtype=object)
    >>> np.array((oct(10), oct(30), oct(100))) # for comparison
    array(['0o12', '0o36', '0o144'], dtype='<U5')

    Using frompyfunc with a function that takes multiple inputs:

    >>> def add(x, y):
    ...     return x + y
    >>> add_array = np.frompyfunc(add, 2, 1)
    >>> add_array(np.array((1, 2, 3)), np.array((4, 5, 6)))
    array([5, 7, 9], dtype=object)
