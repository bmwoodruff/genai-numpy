I will provide you with the docstring for the sort_complex function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.sort_complex. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Sort a complex array using the real part first, then the imaginary part.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        Always returns a sorted complex array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.sort_complex([5, 3, 6, 2, 1])
    array([1.+0.j, 2.+0.j, 3.+0.j, 5.+0.j, 6.+0.j])

    >>> np.sort_complex([1 + 2j, 2 - 1j, 3 - 2j, 3 - 3j, 3 + 5j])
    array([1.+2.j,  2.-1.j,  3.-3.j,  3.-2.j,  3.+5.j])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Sort a complex array using the real part first, then the imaginary part.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array

    Returns
    -------
    out : complex ndarray
        Always returns a sorted complex array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.sort_complex([5, 3, 6, 2, 1])
    array([1.+0.j, 2.+0.j, 3.+0.j, 5.+0.j, 6.+0.j])

    >>> np.sort_complex([1 + 2j, 2 - 1j, 3 - 2j, 3 - 3j, 3 + 5j])
    array([1.+2.j,  2.-1.j,  3.-3.j,  3.-2.j,  3.+5.j])

    Sorting complex numbers with negative real parts:
    
    >>> np.sort_complex([-1 + 2j, -2 - 1j, -3 - 2j, -3 - 3j, -3 + 5j])
    array([-3.-3.j, -3.-2.j, -3.+5.j, -2.-1.j, -1.+2.j])

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only show sorting complex numbers with positive real parts. This new example demonstrates that the function can also handle complex numbers with negative real parts, which is an important aspect of its functionality.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of the function, and the new example provides additional information about its behavior with negative real parts. Adding more examples would likely be redundant or demonstrate edge cases that are not particularly relevant to the function's typical use.
