I will provide you with the docstring for the argwhere function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.argwhere. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Find the indices of array elements that are non-zero, grouped by element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : (N, a.ndim) ndarray
        Indices of elements that are non-zero. Indices are grouped by element.
        This array will have shape ``(N, a.ndim)`` where ``N`` is the number of
        non-zero items.

    See Also
    --------
    where, nonzero

    Notes
    -----
    ``np.argwhere(a)`` is almost the same as ``np.transpose(np.nonzero(a))``,
    but produces a result of the correct shape for a 0D array.

    The output of ``argwhere`` is not suitable for indexing arrays.
    For this purpose use ``nonzero(a)`` instead.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3)
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.argwhere(x>1)
    array([[0, 2],
           [1, 0],
           [1, 1],
           [1, 2]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Find the indices of array elements that are non-zero, grouped by element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : (N, a.ndim) ndarray
        Indices of elements that are non-zero. Indices are grouped by element.
        This array will have shape ``(N, a.ndim)`` where ``N`` is the number of
        non-zero items.

    See Also
    --------
    where, nonzero

    Notes
    -----
    ``np.arg,(a)`` is almost the same as ``np.transpose(np.nonzero(a))``,
    but produces a result of the correct shape for a 0D array.

    The output of ``argwhere`` is not suitable for indexing arrays.
    For this purpose use ``nonzero(a)`` instead.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3)
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.argwhere(x>1)
    array([[0, 2],
           [1, 0],
           [1, 1],
           [1, 2]])

    Using argwhere with a 1D array:
    
    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> np.argwhere(x>1)
    array([[2],
           [3],
           [4],
           [5]])
