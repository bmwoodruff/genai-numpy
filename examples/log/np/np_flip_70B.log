I will provide you with the docstring for the flip function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.flip. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Reverse the order of elements in an array along the given axis.

    The shape of the array is preserved, but the elements are reordered.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
         Axis or axes along which to flip over. The default,
         axis=None, will flip over all of the axes of the input array.
         If axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.

         If axis is a tuple of ints, flipping is performed on all of the axes
         specified in the tuple.

         .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0
            None and tuples of axes are supported

    Returns
    -------
    out : array_like
        A view of `m` with the entries of axis reversed.  Since a view is
        returned, this operation is done in constant time.

    See Also
    --------
    flipud : Flip an array vertically (axis=0).
    fliplr : Flip an array horizontally (axis=1).

    Notes
    -----
    flip(m, 0) is equivalent to flipud(m).

    flip(m, 1) is equivalent to fliplr(m).

    flip(m, n) corresponds to ``m[...,::-1,...]`` with ``::-1`` at position n.

    flip(m) corresponds to ``m[::-1,::-1,...,::-1]`` with ``::-1`` at all
    positions.

    flip(m, (0, 1)) corresponds to ``m[::-1,::-1,...]`` with ``::-1`` at
    position 0 and position 1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> A = np.arange(8).reshape((2,2,2))
    >>> A
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],
           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])
    >>> np.flip(A, 0)
    array([[[4, 5],
            [6, 7]],
           [[0, 1],
            [2, 3]]])
    >>> np.flip(A, 1)
    array([[[2, 3],
            [0, 1]],
           [[6, 7],
            [4, 5]]])
    >>> np.flip(A)
    array([[[7, 6],
            [5, 4]],
           [[3, 2],
            [1, 0]]])
    >>> np.flip(A, (0, 2))
    array([[[5, 4],
            [7, 6]],
           [[1, 0],
            [3, 2]]])
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> A = rng.normal(size=(3,4,5))
    >>> np.all(np.flip(A,2) == A[:,:,::-1,...])
    True

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> A = np.arange(8).reshape((2,2,2))
    >>> A
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],
           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])
    >>> np.flip(A, 0)
    array([[[4, 5],
            [6, 7]],
           [[0, 1],
            [2, 3]]])
    >>> np.flip(A, 1)
    array([[[2, 3],
            [0, 1]],
           [[6, 7],
            [4, 5]]])
    >>> np.flip(A)
    array([[[7, 6],
            [5, 4]],
           [[3, 2],
            [1, 0]]])
    >>> np.flip(A, (0, 2))
    array([[[5, 4],
            [7, 6]],
           [[1, 0],
            [3, 2]]])
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> A = rng.normal(size=(3,4,5))
    >>> np.all(np.flip(A,2) == A[:,:,::-1,...])
    True
    Flipping a 1-D array:
    
    >>> A = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> np.flip(A)
    array([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])

I decided to add an example to show how the `np.flip` function works on a 1-D array. This is a common use case, and it's helpful to illustrate how the function behaves in this scenario.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a variety of scenarios, including flipping along different axes, flipping multiple axes at once, and flipping a 3-D array. The new example I added provides additional insight into the function's behavior, but further examples may not add significant value.
