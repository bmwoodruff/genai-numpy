I will provide you with the docstring for the nanmin function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nanmin. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return minimum of an array or minimum along an axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    When all-NaN slices are encountered a ``RuntimeWarning`` is raised and
    Nan is returned for that slice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose minimum is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the minimum is computed. The default is to compute
        the minimum of the flattened array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary. See
        :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `min` method
        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    initial : scalar, optional
        The maximum value of an output element. Must be present to allow
        computation on empty slice. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to compare for the minimum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    nanmin : ndarray
        An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis
        removed.  If `a` is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an ndarray
        scalar is returned.  The same dtype as `a` is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    nanmax :
        The maximum value of an array along a given axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    amin :
        The minimum value of an array along a given axis, propagating any NaNs.
    fmin :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, ignoring any NaNs.
    minimum :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, propagating any NaNs.
    isnan :
        Shows which elements are Not a Number (NaN).
    isfinite:
        Shows which elements are neither NaN nor infinity.

    amax, fmax, maximum

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
    Positive infinity is treated as a very large number and negative
    infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

    If the input has a integer type the function is equivalent to np.min.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanmin(a)
    1.0
    >>> np.nanmin(a, axis=0)
    array([1.,  2.])
    >>> np.nanmin(a, axis=1)
    array([1.,  3.])

    When positive infinity and negative infinity are present:

    >>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, np.inf])
    1.0
    >>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, -np.inf])
    -inf

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanmin(a)
    1.0
    >>> np.nanmin(a, axis=0)
    array([1.,  2.])
    >>> np.nanmin(a, axis=1)
    array([1.,  3.])

    When positive infinity and negative infinity are present:

    >>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, np.inf])
    1.0
    >>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, -np.inf])
    -inf

    Using the initial parameter:

    >>> np.nanmin([np.nan], initial=10)
    10.0

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `initial` parameter, which was introduced in NumPy 1.22.0. This parameter allows the user to specify a maximum value for an output element, which is necessary when computing on empty slices. The example shows how to use `initial` to specify a default value when the input array contains only NaNs.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.nanmin`, including computing the minimum of a 2D array, computing the minimum along different axes, and handling positive and negative infinity. The additional example I provided demonstrates the use of the `initial` parameter, which is a new feature introduced in a recent version of NumPy.
