I will provide you with the docstring for the ptp function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ptp. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Range of values (maximum - minimum) along an axis.

    The name of the function comes from the acronym for 'peak to peak'.

    .. warning::
        `ptp` preserves the data type of the array. This means the
        return value for an input of signed integers with n bits
        (e.g. `numpy.int8`, `numpy.int16`, etc) is also a signed integer
        with n bits.  In that case, peak-to-peak values greater than
        ``2**(n-1)-1`` will be returned as negative values. An example
        with a work-around is shown below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input values.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis along which to find the peaks.  By default, flatten the
        array.  `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : array_like
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type of the output values will be cast if necessary.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `ptp` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    ptp : ndarray or scalar
        The range of a given array - `scalar` if array is one-dimensional
        or a new array holding the result along the given axis

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[4, 9, 2, 10],
    ...               [6, 9, 7, 12]])

    >>> np.ptp(x, axis=1)
    array([8, 6])

    >>> np.ptp(x, axis=0)
    array([2, 0, 5, 2])

    >>> np.ptp(x)
    10

    This example shows that a negative value can be returned when
    the input is an array of signed integers.

    >>> y = np.array([[1, 127],
    ...               [0, 127],
    ...               [-1, 127],
    ...               [-2, 127]], dtype=np.int8)
    >>> np.ptp(y, axis=1)
    array([ 126,  127, -128, -127], dtype=int8)

    A work-around is to use the `view()` method to view the result as
    unsigned integers with the same bit width:

    >>> np.ptp(y, axis=1).view(np.uint8)
    array([126, 127, 128, 129], dtype=uint8)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[4, 9, 2, 10],
    ...               [6, 9, 7, 12]])

    >>> np.ptp(x, axis=1)
    array([8, 6])

    >>> np.ptp(x, axis=0)
    array([2, 0, 5, 2])

    >>> np.ptp(x)
    10

    This example shows that a negative value can be returned when
    the input is an array of signed integers.

    >>> y = np.array([[1, 127],
    ...               [0, 127],
    ...               [-1, 127],
    ...               [-2, 127]], dtype=np.int8)
    >>> np.ptp(y, axis=1)
    array([ 126,  127, -128, -127], dtype=int8)

    A work-around is to use the `view()` method to view the result as
    unsigned integers with the same bit width:

    >>> np.ptp(y, axis=1).view(np.uint8)
    array([126, 127, 128, 129], dtype=uint8)

    Using ptp with multiple axes:
    >>> z = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
    >>> np.ptp(z, axis=(0, 1))
    array([6, 6, 6])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of `ptp` with multiple axes, as this feature was added in version 1.15.0 and may not be well-known to users. This example shows how to calculate the peak-to-peak value along multiple axes, which can be useful in certain applications.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `ptp`, including the default behavior, specifying an axis, and handling signed integers. The additional example I provided demonstrates the use of `ptp` with multiple axes, which is a more advanced feature. Further examples may be redundant or unnecessary, and may not provide additional clarity or insight into the function's behavior.
