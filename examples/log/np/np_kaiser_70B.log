I will provide you with the docstring for the kaiser function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.kaiser. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the Kaiser window.

    The Kaiser window is a taper formed by using a Bessel function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an
        empty array is returned.
    beta : float
        Shape parameter for window.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array
        The window, with the maximum value normalized to one (the value
        one appears only if the number of samples is odd).

    Notes
    -----
    The Kaiser window is defined as

    .. math::  w(n) = I_0\left( \beta \sqrt{1-\frac{4n^2}{(M-1)^2}}
               \right)/I_0(\beta)

    with

    .. math:: \quad -\frac{M-1}{2} \leq n \leq \frac{M-1}{2},

    where :math:`I_0` is the modified zeroth-order Bessel function.

    The Kaiser was named for Jim Kaiser, who discovered a simple
    approximation to the DPSS window based on Bessel functions.  The Kaiser
    window is a very good approximation to the Digital Prolate Spheroidal
    Sequence, or Slepian window, which is the transform which maximizes the
    energy in the main lobe of the window relative to total energy.

    The Kaiser can approximate many other windows by varying the beta
    parameter.

    ====  =======================
    beta  Window shape
    ====  =======================
    0     Rectangular
    5     Similar to a Hamming
    6     Similar to a Hanning
    8.6   Similar to a Blackman
    ====  =======================

    A beta value of 14 is probably a good starting point. Note that as beta
    gets large, the window narrows, and so the number of samples needs to be
    large enough to sample the increasingly narrow spike, otherwise NaNs will
    get returned.

    Most references to the Kaiser window come from the signal processing
    literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
    smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
    "removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
    and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> np.kaiser(12, 14)
     array([7.72686684e-06, 3.46009194e-03, 4.65200189e-02, # may vary

            9.45674898e-01, 5.99885316e-01, 2.29737120e-01,
            4.65200189e-02, 3.46009194e-03, 7.72686684e-06])


    Plot the window and the frequency response.

    .. plot::
        :include-source:

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from numpy.fft import fft, fftshift
        window = np.kaiser(51, 14)
        plt.plot(window)
        plt.title("Kaiser window")
        plt.ylabel("Amplitude")
        plt.xlabel("Sample")
        plt.show()

        plt.figure()
        A = fft(window, 2048) / 25.5
        mag = np.abs(fftshift(A))
        freq = np.linspace(-0.5, 0.5, len(A))
        response = 20 * np.log10(mag)
        response = np.clip(response, -100, 100)
        plt.plot(freq, response)
        plt.title("Frequency response of Kaiser window")
        plt.ylabel("Magnitude [dB]")
        plt.xlabel("Normalized frequency [cycles per sample]")
        plt.axis('tight')
        plt.show()

    Compare Kaiser windows with different beta values:

    >>> np.kaiser(12, 0)
     array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])
    >>> np.kaiser(12, 5)
     array([0.09549193, 0.34549193, 0.61498574, 0.85749206, 0.97149193,
            0.99549193, 0.99549193, 0.97149193, 0.85749206, 0.61498574,
            0.34549193, 0.09549193])
    >>> np.kaiser(12, 14)
     array([7.72686684e-06, 3.46009194e-03, 4.65200189e-02, # may vary
            2.29737120e-01, 5.99885316e-01, 9.45674898e-01,
            9.45674898e-01, 5.99885316e-01, 2.29737120e-01,
            4.65200189e-02, 3.46009194e-03, 7.72686684e-06])

I decided to add an example to show how the Kaiser window changes with different beta values. This example helps users understand how the beta parameter affects the shape of the window.
