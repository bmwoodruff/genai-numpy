I will provide you with the docstring for the iscomplexobj function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.iscomplexobj. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Check for a complex type or an array of complex numbers.

    The type of the input is checked, not the value. Even if the input
    has an imaginary part equal to zero, `iscomplexobj` evaluates to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : any
        The input can be of any type and shape.

    Returns
    -------
    iscomplexobj : bool
        The return value, True if `x` is of a complex type or has at least
        one complex element.

    See Also
    --------
    isrealobj, iscomplex

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.iscomplexobj(1)
    False
    >>> np.iscomplexobj(1+0j)
    True
    >>> np.iscomplexobj([3, 1+0j, True])
    True

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Check for a complex type or an array of complex numbers.

    The type of the input is checked, not the value. Even if the input
    has an imaginary part equal to zero, `iscomplexobj` evaluates to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : any
        The input can be of any type and shape.

    Returns
    -------
    iscomplexobj : bool
        The return value, True if `x` is of a complex type or has at least
        one complex element.

    See Also
    --------
    isrealobj, iscomplex

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.iscomplexobj(1)
    False
    >>> np.iscomplexobj(1+0j)
    True
    >>> np.iscomplexobj([3, 1+0j, True])
    True
    Complex array example:
    >>> arr = np.array([1, 2, 3]) + 0j
    >>> np.iscomplexobj(arr)
    True

I decided to add an example that demonstrates the behavior of `iscomplexobj` with a complex array, as the existing examples only show scalar inputs. This example helps to illustrate how the function works with array inputs.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic behavior of the function, and the additional example provides further clarification on its behavior with arrays.
