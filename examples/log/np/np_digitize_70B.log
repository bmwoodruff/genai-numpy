I will provide you with the docstring for the digitize function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.digitize. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the indices of the bins to which each value in input array belongs.

    =========  =============  ============================
    `right`    order of bins  returned index `i` satisfies
    =========  =============  ============================
    ``False``  increasing     ``bins[i-1] <= x < bins[i]``
    ``True``   increasing     ``bins[i-1] < x <= bins[i]``
    ``False``  decreasing     ``bins[i-1] > x >= bins[i]``
    ``True``   decreasing     ``bins[i-1] >= x > bins[i]``
    =========  =============  ============================

    If values in `x` are beyond the bounds of `bins`, 0 or ``len(bins)`` is
    returned as appropriate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array to be binned. Prior to NumPy 1.10.0, this array had to
        be 1-dimensional, but can now have any shape.
    bins : array_like
        Array of bins. It has to be 1-dimensional and monotonic.
    right : bool, optional
        Indicating whether the intervals include the right or the left bin
        edge. Default behavior is (right==False) indicating that the interval
        does not include the right edge. The left bin end is open in this
        case, i.e., bins[i-1] <= x < bins[i] is the default behavior for
        monotonically increasing bins.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : ndarray of ints
        Output array of indices, of same shape as `x`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `bins` is not monotonic.
    TypeError
        If the type of the input is complex.

    See Also
    --------
    bincount, histogram, unique, searchsorted

    Notes
    -----
    If values in `x` are such that they fall outside the bin range,
    attempting to index `bins` with the indices that `digitize` returns
    will result in an IndexError.

    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    `numpy.digitize` is  implemented in terms of `numpy.searchsorted`.
    This means that a binary search is used to bin the values, which scales
    much better for larger number of bins than the previous linear search.
    It also removes the requirement for the input array to be 1-dimensional.

    For monotonically *increasing* `bins`, the following are equivalent::

        np.digitize(x, bins, right=True)
        np.searchsorted(bins, x, side='left')

    Note that as the order of the arguments are reversed, the side must be too.
    The `searchsorted` call is marginally faster, as it does not do any
    monotonicity checks. Perhaps more importantly, it supports all dtypes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([0.2, 6.4, 3.0, 1.6])
    >>> bins = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.5, 4.0, 10.0])
    >>> inds = np.digitize(x, bins)
    >>> inds
    array([1, 4, 3, 2])
    >>> for n in range(x.size):
    ...   print(bins[inds[n]-1], "<=", x[n], "<", bins[inds[n]])
    ...
    0.0 <= 0.2 < 1.0
    4.0 <= 6.4 < 10.0
    2.5 <= 3.0 < 4.0
    1.0 <= 1.6 < 2.5

    >>> x = np.array([1.2, 10.0, 12.4, 15.5, 20.])
    >>> bins = np.array([0, 5, 10, 15, 20])
    >>> np.digitize(x,bins,right=True)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])
    >>> np.digitize(x,bins,right=False)
    array([1, 3, 3, 4, 5])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([0.2, 6.4, 3.0, 1.6])
    >>> bins = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.5, 4.0, 10.0])
    >>> inds = np.digitize(x, bins)
    >>> inds
    array([1, 4, 3, 2])
    >>> for n in range(x.size):
    ...   print(bins[inds[n]-1], "<=", x[n], "<", bins[inds[n]])
    ...
    0.0 <= 0.2 < 1.0
    4.0 <= 6.4 < 10.0
    2.5 <= 3.0 < 4.0
    1.0 <= 1.6 < 2.5

    >>> x = np.array([1.2, 10.0, 12.4, 15.5, 20.])
    >>> bins = np.array([0, 5, 10, 15, 20])
    >>> np.digitize(x,bins,right=True)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])
    >>> np.digitize(x,bins,right=False)
    array([1, 3, 3, 4, 5])

    Non-monotonic bins:
    >>> bins = np.array([0.0, 2.5, 1.0, 4.0, 10.0])
    >>> np.digitize(x, bins)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    ValueError: The bins must be monotonic
