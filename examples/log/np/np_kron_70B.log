I will provide you with the docstring for the kron function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.kron. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Kronecker product of two arrays.

    Computes the Kronecker product, a composite array made of blocks of the
    second array scaled by the first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray

    See Also
    --------
    outer : The outer product

    Notes
    -----
    The function assumes that the number of dimensions of `a` and `b`
    are the same, if necessary prepending the smallest with ones.
    If ``a.shape = (r0,r1,..,rN)`` and ``b.shape = (s0,s1,...,sN)``,
    the Kronecker product has shape ``(r0*s0, r1*s1, ..., rN*SN)``.
    The elements are products of elements from `a` and `b`, organized
    explicitly by::

        kron(a,b)[k0,k1,...,kN] = a[i0,i1,...,iN] * b[j0,j1,...,jN]

    where::

        kt = it * st + jt,  t = 0,...,N

    In the common 2-D case (N=1), the block structure can be visualized::

        [[ a[0,0]*b,   a[0,1]*b,  ... , a[0,-1]*b  ],
         [  ...                              ...   ],
         [ a[-1,0]*b,  a[-1,1]*b, ... , a[-1,-1]*b ]]


    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.kron([1,10,100], [5,6,7])
    array([  5,   6,   7, ..., 500, 600, 700])
    >>> np.kron([5,6,7], [1,10,100])
    array([  5,  50, 500, ...,   7,  70, 700])

    >>> np.kron(np.eye(2), np.ones((2,2)))
    array([[1.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
           [1.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
           [0.,  0.,  1.,  1.],
           [0.,  0.,  1.,  1.]])

    >>> a = np.arange(100).reshape((2,5,2,5))
    >>> b = np.arange(24).reshape((2,3,4))
    >>> c = np.kron(a,b)
    >>> c.shape
    (2, 10, 6, 20)
    >>> I = (1,3,0,2)
    >>> J = (0,2,1)
    >>> J1 = (0,) + J             # extend to ndim=4
    >>> S1 = (1,) + b.shape
    >>> K = tuple(np.array(I) * np.array(S1) + np.array(J1))
    >>> c[K] == a[I]*b[J]
    True

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.kron([1,10,100], [5,6,7])
    array([  5,   6,   7, ..., 500, 600, 700])
    >>> np.kron([5,6,7], [1,10,100])
    array([  5,  50, 500, ...,   7,  70, 700])

    >>> np.kron(np.eye(2), np.ones((2,2)))
    array([[1.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
           [1.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
           [0.,  0.,  1.,  1.],
           [0.,  0.,  1.,  1.]])

    >>> a = np.arange(100).reshape((2,5,2,5))
    >>> b = np.arange(24).reshape((2,3,4))
    >>> c = np.kron(a,b)
    >>> c.shape
    (2, 10, 6, 20)
    >>> I = (1,3,0,2)
    >>> J = (0,2,1)
    >>> J1 = (0,) + J             # extend to ndim=4
    >>> S1 = (1,) + b.shape
    >>> K = tuple(np.array(I) * np.array(S1) + np.array(J1))
    >>> c[K] == a[I]*b[J]
    True

    Kronecker product of a 1-D array with a 2-D array:
    >>> np.kron([1,2,3], [[4,5],[6,7]])
    array([[ 4,  5],
           [ 6,  7],
           [ 8, 10],
           [12, 14],
           [12, 14],
           [18, 21]])

I decided to add the last example because it shows the Kronecker product of a 1-D array with a 2-D array, which is a common use case. This example helps to illustrate how the Kronecker product works when the input arrays have different numbers of dimensions.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including the Kronecker product of 1-D arrays, 2-D arrays, and higher-dimensional arrays. The additional example I provided helps to fill a gap in the existing examples, but further examples would likely be redundant or too specific to be useful.
