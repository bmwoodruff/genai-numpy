I will provide you with the docstring for the fill_diagonal function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fill_diagonal. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

Fill the main diagonal of the given array of any dimensionality.

    For an array `a` with ``a.ndim >= 2``, the diagonal is the list of
    values ``a[i, ..., i]`` with indices ``i`` all identical.  This function
    modifies the input array in-place without returning a value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array, at least 2-D.
      Array whose diagonal is to be filled in-place.
    val : scalar or array_like
      Value(s) to write on the diagonal. If `val` is scalar, the value is
      written along the diagonal. If array-like, the flattened `val` is
      written along the diagonal, repeating if necessary to fill all
      diagonal entries.

    wrap : bool
      For tall matrices in NumPy version up to 1.6.2, the
      diagonal "wrapped" after N columns. You can have this behavior
      with this option. This affects only tall matrices.

    --------
    diag_indices, diag_indices_from

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    This functionality can be obtained via `diag_indices`, but internally
    this version uses a much faster implementation that never constructs the
    indices and uses simple slicing.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 5)
    >>> a
    array([[5, 0, 0],
           [0, 5, 0],
           [0, 0, 5]])

    The same function can operate on a 4-D array:

    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3, 3, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 4)

    We only show a few blocks for clarity:

    >>> a[0, 0]
    array([[4, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> a[1, 1]
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> a[2, 2]
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 4]])

    The wrap option affects only tall matrices:

    >>> # tall matrices no wrap
    >>> a = np.zeros((5, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 4)
    >>> a
    array([[4, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 4],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])

    >>> # tall matrices wrap
    >>> a = np.zeros((5, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 4, wrap=True)
    >>> a
    array([[4, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 4],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [4, 0, 0]])

    >>> # wide matrices
    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 5), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 4, wrap=True)
    >>> a
    array([[4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]])

    The anti-diagonal can be filled by reversing the order of elements
    using either `numpy.flipud` or `numpy.fliplr`.

    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3), int);
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(np.fliplr(a), [1,2,3])  # Horizontal flip
    >>> a
    array([[0, 0, 1],
           [0, 2, 0],
           [3, 0, 0]])
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(np.flipud(a), [1,2,3])  # Vertical flip
    >>> a
    array([[0, 0, 3],
           [0, 2, 0],
           [1, 0, 0]])

    Note that the order in which the diagonal is filled varies depending
    on the flip function.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 5)
    >>> a
    array([[5, 0, 0],
           [0, 5, 0],
           [0, 0, 5]])

    The same function can operate on a 4-D array:

    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3, 3, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 4)

    We only show a few blocks for clarity:

    >>> a[0, 0]
    array([[4, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> a[1, 1]
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> a[2, 2]
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 4]])

    The wrap option affects only tall matrices:

    >>> # tall matrices no wrap
    >>> a = np.zeros((5, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 4)
    >>> a
    array([[4, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 4],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])

    >>> # tall matrices wrap
    >>> a = np.zeros((5, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 4, wrap=True)
    >>> a
    array([[4, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 4],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [4, 0, 0]])

    >>> # wide matrices
    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 5), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, 4, wrap=True)
    >>> a
    array([[4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]])

    The anti-diagonal can be filled by reversing the order of elements
    using either `numpy.flipud` or `numpy.fliplr`.

    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3), int);
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(np.fliplr(a), [1,2,3])  # Horizontal flip
    >>> a
    array([[0, 0, 1],
           [0, 2, 0],
           [3, 0, 0]])
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(np.flipud(a), [1,2,3])  # Vertical flip
    >>> a
    array([[0, 0, 3],
           [0, 2, 0],
           [1, 0, 0]])

    Filling the diagonal with an array-like value:

    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 3), int)
    >>> np.fill_diagonal(a, [1, 2, 3])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 0, 0],
           [0, 2, 0],
           [0, 0, 3]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate filling the diagonal with an array-like value, as this is a valid use case mentioned in the function's documentation. This example helps to clarify how the function behaves when given an array-like value for the `val` parameter.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a wide range of scenarios, including different dimensionalities, the `wrap` option, and filling the anti-diagonal. The additional example I provided helps to fill a gap in the documentation, but further examples would likely be redundant or too specific.
