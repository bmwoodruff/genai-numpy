You are a helpful assistant working to improve the NumPy documentation. Use numpydoc style guidelines.

I will provide you with the docstring for the positive function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.positive. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

positive(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Numerical positive, element-wise.

.. versionadded:: 1.13.0

Parameters
----------
x : array_like or scalar
    Input array.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray or scalar
    Returned array or scalar: `y = +x`.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

Notes
-----
Equivalent to `x.copy()`, but only defined for types that support
arithmetic.

Examples
--------

>>> x1 = np.array(([1., -1.]))
>>> np.positive(x1)
array([ 1., -1.])

The unary ``+`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.positive`` on
ndarrays.

>>> x1 = np.array(([1., -1.]))
>>> +x1
array([ 1., -1.])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

Examples
--------
>>> x1 = np.array(([1., -1.]))
>>> np.positive(x1)
array([ 1., -1.])

The unary ``+`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.positive`` on
ndarrays.

>>> x1 = np.array(([1., -1.]))
>>> +x1
array([ 1., -1.])

Scalar input:
 
>>> np.positive(-1)
-1
