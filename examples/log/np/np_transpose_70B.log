I will provide you with the docstring for the transpose function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.transpose. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Returns an array with axes transposed.

    For a 1-D array, this returns an unchanged view of the original array, as a
    transposed vector is simply the same vector.
    To convert a 1-D array into a 2-D column vector, an additional dimension
    must be added, e.g., ``np.atleast_2d(a).T`` achieves this, as does
    ``a[:, np.newaxis]``.
    For a 2-D array, this is the standard matrix transpose.
    For an n-D array, if axes are given, their order indicates how the
    axes are permuted (see Examples). If axes are not provided, then
    ``transpose(a).shape == a.shape[::-1]``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axes : tuple or list of ints, optional
        If specified, it must be a tuple or list which contains a permutation
        of [0,1,...,N-1] where N is the number of axes of `a`. The `i`'th axis
        of the returned array will correspond to the axis numbered ``axes[i]``
        of the input. If not specified, defaults to ``range(a.ndim)[::-1]``,
        which reverses the order of the axes.

    Returns
    -------
    p : ndarray
        `a` with its axes permuted. A view is returned whenever possible.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.transpose : Equivalent method.
    moveaxis : Move axes of an array to new positions.
    argsort : Return the indices that would sort an array.

    Notes
    -----
    Use ``transpose(a, argsort(axes))`` to invert the transposition of tensors
    when using the `axes` keyword argument.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4]])
    >>> np.transpose(a)
    array([[1, 3],
           [2, 4]])

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> a
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.transpose(a)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])

    >>> a = np.ones((1, 2, 3))
    >>> np.transpose(a, (1, 0, 2)).shape
    (2, 1, 3)

    >>> a = np.ones((2, 3, 4, 5))
    >>> np.transpose(a).shape
    (5, 4, 3, 2)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4]])
    >>> np.transpose(a)
    array([[1, 3],
           [2, 4]])

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> a
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.transpose(a)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])

    >>> a = np.ones((1, 2, 3))
    >>> np.transpose(a, (1, 0, 2)).shape
    (2, 1, 3)

    >>> a = np.ones((2, 3, 4, 5))
    >>> np.transpose(a).shape
    (5, 4, 3, 2)

    Transposing a 3-D array with default axes order:
    >>> a = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
    >>> np.transpose(a)
    array([[[1, 5],
            [3, 7]],

           [[2, 6],
            [4, 8]]])

I decided to add the last example because it shows the default behavior of the transpose function when the axes are not specified for a 3-D array. This can help users understand how the function works in a more complex scenario.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of the transpose function, including 1-D, 2-D, and n-D arrays, as well as specifying custom axes orders. The additional example I added provides further clarification on the default behavior of the function.
