I will provide you with the docstring for the compress function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.compress. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return selected slices of an array along given axis.

    When working along a given axis, a slice along that axis is returned in
    `output` for each index where `condition` evaluates to True. When
    working on a 1-D array, `compress` is equivalent to `extract`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    condition : 1-D array of bools
        Array that selects which entries to return. If len(condition)
        is less than the size of `a` along the given axis, then output is
        truncated to the length of the condition array.
    a : array_like
        Array from which to extract a part.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to take slices. If None (default), work on the
        flattened array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Output array.  Its type is preserved and it must be of the right
        shape to hold the output.

    Returns
    -------
    compressed_array : ndarray
        A copy of `a` without the slices along axis for which `condition`
        is false.

    extract : Equivalent method when working on 1-D arrays
    :ref:`ufuncs-output-type`

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> np.compress([0, 1], a, axis=0)
    array([[3, 4]])
    >>> np.compress([False, True, True], a, axis=0)
    array([[3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> np.compress([False, True], a, axis=1)
    array([[2],
           [4],
           [6]])

    Working on the flattened array does not return slices along an axis but
    selects elements.

    >>> np.compress([False, True], a)
    array([2])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> np.compress([0, 1], a, axis=0)
    array([[3, 4]])
    >>> np.compress([False, True, True], a, axis=0)
    array([[3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> np.compress([False, True], a, axis=1)
    array([[2],
           [4],
           [6]])

    Working on the flattened array does not return slices along an axis but
    selects elements.

    >>> np.compress([False, True], a)
    array([2])

    Using compress with a 1-D array:
    
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> np.compress([True, False, True, False, True], a)
    array([1, 3, 5])

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only demonstrate the use of `compress` on 2-D arrays, but it's also important to show how it works on 1-D arrays, which is equivalent to `extract`. This example helps to clarify the behavior of `compress` in this case.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of `compress`, and the additional example I added provides further clarification on its behavior with 1-D arrays.
