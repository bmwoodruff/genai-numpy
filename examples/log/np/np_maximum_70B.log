I will provide you with the docstring for the maximum function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.maximum. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

maximum(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Element-wise maximum of array elements.

Compare two arrays and return a new array containing the element-wise
maxima. If one of the elements being compared is a NaN, then that
element is returned. If both elements are NaNs then the first is
returned. The latter distinction is important for complex NaNs, which
are defined as at least one of the real or imaginary parts being a NaN.
The net effect is that NaNs are propagated.

Parameters
----------
x1, x2 : array_like
    The arrays holding the elements to be compared.
    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray or scalar
    The maximum of `x1` and `x2`, element-wise.
    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

See Also
--------
minimum :
    Element-wise minimum of two arrays, propagates NaNs.
fmax :
    Element-wise maximum of two arrays, ignores NaNs.
amax :
    The maximum value of an array along a given axis, propagates NaNs.
nanmax :
    The maximum value of an array along a given axis, ignores NaNs.

fmin, amin, nanmin

Notes
-----
The maximum is equivalent to ``np.where(x1 >= x2, x1, x2)`` when
neither x1 nor x2 are nans, but it is faster and does proper
broadcasting.

Examples
--------
>>> np.maximum([2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 2])
array([2, 5, 4])

>>> np.maximum(np.eye(2), [0.5, 2]) # broadcasting
array([[ 1. ,  2. ],
       [ 0.5,  2. ]])

>>> np.maximum([np.nan, 0, np.nan], [0, np.nan, np.nan])
array([nan, nan, nan])
>>> np.maximum(np.inf, 1)
inf

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.maximum([2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 2])
array([2, 5, 4])

>>> np.maximum(np.eye(2), [0.5, 2]) # broadcasting
array([[ 1. ,  2. ],
       [ 0.5,  2. ]])

>>> np.maximum([np.nan, 0, np.nan], [0, np.nan, np.nan])
array([nan, nan, nan])

>>> np.maximum(np.inf, 1)
inf

Maximum of complex numbers:
 
>>> np.maximum(2 + 3j, 1 + 2j)
(2+3j)

I decided to add the example of taking the maximum of complex numbers because the docstring mentions that the function handles complex NaNs, but it doesn't provide an example of how it handles complex numbers in general. This example shows that the function works as expected with complex numbers.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a good range of cases, including broadcasting, NaNs, and infinity. The new example adds a specific case that was not previously covered, but it's not necessary to add more examples at this point.
