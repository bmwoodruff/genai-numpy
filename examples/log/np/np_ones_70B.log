I will provide you with the docstring for the ones function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ones. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return a new array of given shape and type, filled with ones.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : int or sequence of ints
        Shape of the new array, e.g., ``(2, 3)`` or ``2``.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type for the array, e.g., `numpy.int8`.  Default is
        `numpy.float64`.
    order : {'C', 'F'}, optional, default: C
        Whether to store multi-dimensional data in row-major
        (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order in
        memory.
    device : str, optional
        The device on which to place the created array. Default: None.
        For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``"cpu"`` if passed.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of ones with the given shape, dtype, and order.

    See Also
    --------
    ones_like : Return an array of ones with shape and type of input.
    empty : Return a new uninitialized array.
    zeros : Return a new array setting values to zero.
    full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.ones(5)
    array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])

    >>> np.ones((5,), dtype=int)
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

    >>> np.ones((2, 1))
    array([[1.],
           [1.]])

    >>> s = (2,2)
    >>> np.ones(s)
    array([[1.,  1.],
           [1.,  1.]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.ones(5)
    array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])

    >>> np.ones((5,), dtype=int)
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

    >>> np.ones((2, 1))
    array([[1.],
           [1.]])

    >>> s = (2,2)
    >>> np.ones(s)
    array([[1.,  1.],
           [1.,  1.]])

    Creating a 3D array with ones:
    
    >>> np.ones((2, 2, 2))
    array([[[1., 1.],
            [1., 1.]],

           [[1., 1.],
            [1., 1.]]])

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only demonstrate creating 1D and 2D arrays with ones. This new example shows how to create a 3D array with ones, which can be a common use case in many applications.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples, along with the new one, cover a good range of scenarios for using the `ones` function. The examples demonstrate creating arrays with different shapes, dtypes, and dimensions, which should be sufficient for users to understand how to use the function.
