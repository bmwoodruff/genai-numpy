I will provide you with the docstring for the tanh function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.tanh. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

tanh(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Compute hyperbolic tangent element-wise.

Equivalent to ``np.sinh(x)/np.cosh(x)`` or ``-1j * np.tan(1j*x)``.

Parameters
----------
x : array_like
    Input array.
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray
    The corresponding hyperbolic tangent values.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

Notes
-----
If `out` is provided, the function writes the result into it,
and returns a reference to `out`.  (See Examples)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.tanh((0, np.pi*1j, np.pi*1j/2))
array([ 0. +0.00000000e+00j,  0. -1.22460635e-16j,  0. +1.63317787e+16j])

>>> # Example of providing the optional output parameter illustrating
>>> # that what is returned is a reference to said parameter
>>> out1 = np.array([0], dtype='d')
>>> out2 = np.tanh([0.1], out1)
>>> out2 is out1
True

>>> # Example of ValueError due to provision of shape mis-matched `out`
>>> np.tanh(np.zeros((3,3)),np.zeros((2,2)))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,3) (2,2)

Computing hyperbolic tangent of a scalar:
 
>>> np.tanh(1.0)

I decided to add an example to show how the `np.tanh` function works with a scalar input, as this is a common use case and the existing examples only demonstrate array inputs. This example helps to illustrate the function's behavior in a simple and intuitive way.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including array inputs, providing an optional output parameter, and raising a `ValueError` for shape mis-matched `out`. The added example complements these cases by demonstrating the function's behavior with a scalar input.
