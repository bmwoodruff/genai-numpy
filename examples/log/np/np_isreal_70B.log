I will provide you with the docstring for the isreal function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.isreal. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Returns a bool array, where True if input element is real.

    If element has complex type with zero imaginary part, the return value
    for that element is True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray, bool
        Boolean array of same shape as `x`.

    Notes
    -----
    `isreal` may behave unexpectedly for string or object arrays (see examples)

    See Also
    --------
    iscomplex
    isrealobj : Return True if x is not a complex type.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1+1j, 1+0j, 4.5, 3, 2, 2j], dtype=complex)
    >>> np.isreal(a)
    array([False,  True,  True,  True,  True, False])

    The function does not work on string arrays.

    >>> a = np.array([2j, "a"], dtype="U")
    >>> np.isreal(a)  # Warns about non-elementwise comparison
    False

    Returns True for all elements in input array of ``dtype=object`` even if
    any of the elements is complex.

    >>> a = np.array([1, "2", 3+4j], dtype=object)
    >>> np.isreal(a)
    array([ True,  True,  True])

    isreal should not be used with object arrays

    >>> a = np.array([1+2j, 2+1j], dtype=object)
    >>> np.isreal(a)
    array([ True,  True])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Returns a bool array, where True if input element is real.

    If element has complex type with zero imaginary part, the return value
    for that element is True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray, bool
        Boolean array of same shape as `x`.

    Notes
    -----
    `isreal` may behave unexpectedly for string or object arrays (see examples)

    See Also
    --------
    iscomplex
    isrealobj : Return True if x is not a complex type.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1+1j, 1+0j, 4.5, 3, 2, 2j], dtype=complex)
    >>> np.isreal(a)
    array([False,  True,  True,  True,  True, False])

    The function does not work on string arrays.

    >>> a = np.array([2j, "a"], dtype="U")
    >>> np.isreal(a)  # Warns about non-elementwise comparison
    False

    Returns True for all elements in input array of ``dtype=object`` even if
    any of the elements is complex.

    >>> a = np.array([1, "2", 3+4j], dtype=object)
    >>> np.isreal(a)
    array([ True,  True,  True])

    isreal should not be used with object arrays

    >>> a = np.array([1+2j, 2+1j], dtype=object)
    >>> np.isreal(a)
    array([ True,  True])

    Using isreal with a real-valued array:
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> np.isreal(a)
    array([ True,  True,  True,  True,  True])

I decided to add an example to show how `np.isreal` behaves when used with a real-valued array, as this is a common use case. This example helps to illustrate the function's behavior in a straightforward scenario, which can aid in understanding its behavior in more complex cases.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including complex arrays, string arrays, and object arrays. The additional example I added provides a simple, intuitive demonstration of the function's behavior, but further examples may not add significant value to the documentation.
