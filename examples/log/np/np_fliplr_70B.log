I will provide you with the docstring for the fliplr function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fliplr. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Reverse the order of elements along axis 1 (left/right).

    For a 2-D array, this flips the entries in each row in the left/right
    direction. Columns are preserved, but appear in a different order than
    before.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array, must be at least 2-D.

    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        A view of `m` with the columns reversed.  Since a view
        is returned, this operation is :math:`\mathcal O(1)`.

    See Also
    --------
    flipud : Flip array in the up/down direction.
    flip : Flip array in one or more dimensions.
    rot90 : Rotate array counterclockwise.

    Notes
    -----
    Equivalent to ``m[:,::-1]`` or ``np.flip(m, axis=1)``.
    Requires the array to be at least 2-D.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> A = np.diag([1.,2.,3.])
    >>> A
    array([[1.,  0.,  0.],
           [0.,  2.,  0.],
           [0.,  0.,  3.]])
    >>> np.fliplr(A)
    array([[0.,  0.,  1.],
           [0.,  2.,  0.],
           [3.,  0.,  0.]])

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> A = rng.normal(size=(2,3,5))
    >>> np.all(np.fliplr(A) == A[:,::-1,...])
    True

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Reverse the order of elements along axis 1 (left/right).

    For a 2-D array, this flips the entries in each row in the left/right
    direction. Columns are preserved, but appear in a different order than
    before.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array, must be at least 2-D.

    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        A view of `m` with the columns reversed.  Since a view
        is returned, this operation is :math:`\mathcal O(1)`.

    See Also
    --------

    Examples

           [0.,  2.,  0.],
           [0.,  0.,  3.]])
    >>> np.fliplr(A)
    array([[0.,  0.,  1.],
           [0.,  2.,  0.],
           [3.,  0.,  0.]])

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> A = rng.normal(size=(2,3,5))
    >>> np.all(np.fliplr(A) == A[:,::-1,...])
    True

    Flipping a 2-D array with non-square shape:
    >>> A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])
    >>> np.fliplr(A)
    array([[4, 3, 2, 1],
           [8, 7, 6, 5]])
