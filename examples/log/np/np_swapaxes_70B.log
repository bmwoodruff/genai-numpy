I will provide you with the docstring for the swapaxes function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.swapaxes. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Interchange two axes of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis1 : int
        First axis.
    axis2 : int
        Second axis.

    Returns
    -------
    a_swapped : ndarray
        For NumPy >= 1.10.0, if `a` is an ndarray, then a view of `a` is
        returned; otherwise a new array is created. For earlier NumPy
        versions a view of `a` is returned only if the order of the
        axes is changed, otherwise the input array is returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3]])
    >>> np.swapaxes(x,0,1)
    array([[1],
           [2],
           [3]])

    >>> x = np.array([[[0,1],[2,3]],[[4,5],[6,7]]])
    >>> x
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],
           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])

    >>> np.swapaxes(x,0,2)
    array([[[0, 4],
            [2, 6]],
           [[1, 5],
            [3, 7]]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Interchange two axes of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis1 : int
        First axis.
    axis2 : int
        Second axis.

    Returns
    -------
    a_swapped : ndarray
        For NumPy >= 1.10.0, if `a` is an ndarray, then a view of `a` is
        returned; otherwise a new array is created. For earlier NumPy
        versions a view of `a` is returned only if the order of the
        axes is changed, otherwise the input array is returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3]])
    >>> np.swapaxes(x,0,1)
    array([[1],
           [2],
           [3]])

    >>> x = np.array([[[0,1],[2,3]],[[4,5],[6,7]]])
    >>> x
    array([[[0, 1],
            [2, 3]],
           [[4, 5],
            [6, 7]]])

    >>> np.swapaxes(x,0,2)
    array([[[0, 4],
            [2, 6]],
           [[1, 5],
            [3, 7]]])

    Swapping axes of a 1D array:
    
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> np.swapaxes(x,0,0)
    array([1, 2, 3])

I decided to add an example to show the behavior of `np.swapaxes` when swapping axes of a 1D array, as the existing examples only demonstrate its usage with 2D and 3D arrays. This additional example helps to clarify the function's behavior in a simpler case.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of `np.swapaxes`, and the additional example provides further clarification on its behavior with 1D arrays. Adding more examples would not provide significant additional value to the documentation.
