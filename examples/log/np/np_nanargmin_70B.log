I will provide you with the docstring for the nanargmin function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nanargmin. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the indices of the minimum values in the specified axis ignoring
    NaNs. For all-NaN slices ``ValueError`` is raised. Warning: the results
    cannot be trusted if a slice contains only NaNs and Infs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to operate.  By default flattened input is used.
    out : array, optional
        If provided, the result will be inserted into this array. It should
        be of the appropriate shape and dtype.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    index_array : ndarray
        An array of indices or a single index value.

    See Also
    --------
    argmin, nanargmax

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[np.nan, 4], [2, 3]])
    >>> np.argmin(a)
    0
    >>> np.nanargmin(a)
    2
    >>> np.nanargmin(a, axis=0)
    array([1, 1])
    >>> np.nanargmin(a, axis=1)
    array([1, 0])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[np.nan, 4], [2, 3]])
    >>> np.argmin(a)
    0
    >>> np.nanargmin(a)
    2
    >>> np.nanargmin(a, axis=0)
    array([1, 1])
    >>> np.nanargmin(a, axis=1)
    array([1, 0])
    Using nanargmin with all-NaN slices:
    
    >>> a = np.array([[np.nan, np.nan], [np.nan, np.nan]])
    >>> try:
    ...     np.nanargmin(a)
    ... except ValueError as e:
    ...     print(e)
    All-NaN slice encountered
