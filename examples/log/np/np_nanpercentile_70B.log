I will provide you with the docstring for the nanpercentile function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nanpercentile. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Compute the qth percentile of the data along the specified axis,
    while ignoring nan values.

    Returns the qth percentile(s) of the array elements.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array, containing
        nan values to be ignored.
    q : array_like of float
        Percentile or sequence of percentiles to compute, which must be
        between 0 and 100 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the percentiles are computed. The default
        is to compute the percentile(s) along a flattened version of the
        array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape and buffer length as the expected output, but the
        type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by
        intermediate calculations, to save memory. In this case, the
        contents of the input `a` after this function completes is
        undefined.
    method : str, optional
        This parameter specifies the method to use for estimating the
        percentile.  There are many different methods, some unique to NumPy.
        See the notes for explanation.  The options sorted by their R type
        as summarized in the H&F paper [1]_ are:

        1. 'inverted_cdf'
        2. 'averaged_inverted_cdf'
        3. 'closest_observation'
        4. 'interpolated_inverted_cdf'
        5. 'hazen'
        6. 'weibull'
        7. 'linear'  (default)
        8. 'median_unbiased'
        9. 'normal_unbiased'

        The first three methods are discontinuous.  NumPy further defines the
        following discontinuous variations of the default 'linear' (7.) option:

        * 'lower'
        * 'higher',
        * 'midpoint'
        * 'nearest'

        .. versionchanged:: 1.22.0
            This argument was previously called "interpolation" and only
            offered the "linear" default and last four options.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

        If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
        through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
        `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
        a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
        will raise a RuntimeError.

    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each value in
        `a` contributes to the percentile according to its associated weight.
        The weights array can either be 1-D (in which case its length must be
        the size of `a` along the given axis) or of the same shape as `a`.
        If `weights=None`, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a
        weight equal to one.
        Only `method="inverted_cdf"` supports weights.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    interpolation : str, optional
        Deprecated name for the method keyword argument.

        .. deprecated:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    percentile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple percentiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the percentiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    nanmean
    nanmedian : equivalent to ``nanpercentile(..., 50)``
    percentile, median, mean
    nanquantile : equivalent to nanpercentile, except q in range [0, 1].

    Notes
    -----
    The behavior of `numpy.nanpercentile` with percentage `q` is that of
    `numpy.quantile` with argument ``q/100`` (ignoring nan values).
    For more information, please see `numpy.quantile`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10., 7., 4.], [3., 2., 1.]])
    >>> a[0][1] = np.nan
    >>> a
    array([[10.,  nan,   4.],
          [ 3.,   2.,   1.]])
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50)
    np.float64(nan)
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50)
    3.0
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0)
    array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[7.],
           [2.]])
    >>> m = np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0)
    >>> out = np.zeros_like(m)
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0, out=out)
    array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
    >>> m
    array([6.5,  2. ,  2.5])

    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanpercentile(b, 50, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([7., 2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10., 7., 4.], [3., 2., 1.]])
    >>> a[0][1] = np.nan
    >>> a
    array([[10.,  nan,   4.],
          [ 3.,   2.,   1.]])
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50)
    np.float64(nan)
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50)
    3.0
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0)
    array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[7.],
           [2.]])
    >>> m = np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0)
    >>> out = np.zeros_like(m)
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0, out=out)
    array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
    >>> m
    array([6.5,  2. ,  2.5])

    >>> b = a.copy()
    >>> np.nanpercentile(b, 50, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([7., 2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a==b)

    Weights example:
    >>> a = np.array([[10., 7., 4.], [3., 2., 1.]])
    >>> a[0][1] = np.nan
    >>> weights = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0, weights=weights)
    array([5.5, 3.5, 3.5])

I decided to add an example that demonstrates the use of weights, as this feature was added in version 2.0.0 and is not shown in the existing examples. This example helps to illustrate how the weights array can be used to influence the percentile calculation.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a wide range of use cases, including different axis values, the use of `keepdims`, and the `overwrite_input` option. The added example provides additional insight into the `weights` feature, which is a unique aspect of the `nanpercentile` function.
