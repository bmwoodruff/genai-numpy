I will provide you with the docstring for the column_stack function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.column_stack. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.

    Take a sequence of 1-D arrays and stack them as columns
    to make a single 2-D array. 2-D arrays are stacked as-is,
    just like with `hstack`.  1-D arrays are turned into 2-D columns
    first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tup : sequence of 1-D or 2-D arrays.
        Arrays to stack. All of them must have the same first dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    stacked : 2-D array
        The array formed by stacking the given arrays.

    See Also
    --------
    stack, hstack, vstack, concatenate

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array((1,2,3))
    >>> b = np.array((2,3,4))
    >>> np.column_stack((a,b))
    array([[1, 2],
           [2, 3],
           [3, 4]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array((1,2,3))
    >>> b = np.array((2,3,4))
    >>> np.column_stack((a,b))
    array([[1, 2],
           [2, 3],
           [3, 4]])

    Stacking multiple arrays:
    
    >>> a = np.array((1,2,3))
    >>> b = np.array((2,3,4))
    >>> c = np.array((3,4,5))
    >>> np.column_stack((a,b,c))
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [3, 4, 5]])


I decided to add an example to demonstrate how `np.column_stack` can be used to stack multiple arrays. This is a common use case, and the additional example helps to clarify the behavior of the function in this scenario.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic functionality of `np.column_stack`, and the additional example provides further clarification on how to use the function with multiple arrays. Adding more examples at this point would likely be redundant and may make the documentation more cluttered than helpful.
