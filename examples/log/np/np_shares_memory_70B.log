I will provide you with the docstring for the shares_memory function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.shares_memory. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    shares_memory(a, b, /, max_work=None)

    Determine if two arrays share memory.

    .. warning::

       This function can be exponentially slow for some inputs, unless
       `max_work` is set to a finite number or ``MAY_SHARE_BOUNDS``.
       If in doubt, use `numpy.may_share_memory` instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : ndarray
        Input arrays
    max_work : int, optional
        Effort to spend on solving the overlap problem (maximum number
        of candidate solutions to consider). The following special
        values are recognized:

        max_work=MAY_SHARE_EXACT  (default)
            The problem is solved exactly. In this case, the function returns
            True only if there is an element shared between the arrays. Finding
            the exact solution may take extremely long in some cases.
        max_work=MAY_SHARE_BOUNDS
            Only the memory bounds of a and b are checked.

    Raises
    ------
    numpy.exceptions.TooHardError
        Exceeded max_work.

    Returns
    -------
    out : bool

    See Also
    --------
    may_share_memory

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.shares_memory(x, np.array([5, 6, 7]))
    False
    >>> np.shares_memory(x[::2], x)
    True
    >>> np.shares_memory(x[::2], x[1::2])
    False

    Checking whether two arrays share memory is NP-complete, and
    runtime may increase exponentially in the number of
    dimensions. Hence, `max_work` should generally be set to a finite
    number, as it is possible to construct examples that take
    extremely long to run:

    >>> from numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided
    >>> x = np.zeros([192163377], dtype=np.int8)
    >>> x1 = as_strided(
    ...     x, strides=(36674, 61119, 85569), shape=(1049, 1049, 1049))
    >>> x2 = as_strided(
    ...     x[64023025:], strides=(12223, 12224, 1), shape=(1049, 1049, 1))
    >>> np.shares_memory(x1, x2, max_work=1000)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    numpy.exceptions.TooHardError: Exceeded max_work

    Running ``np.shares_memory(x1, x2)`` without `max_work` set takes
    around 1 minute for this case. It is possible to find problems
    that take still significantly longer.

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    ...
    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> np.shares_memory(x, np.array([5, 6, 7]))

    >>> np.shares_memory(x[::2], x)
    True
    >>> np.shares_memory(x[::2], x[1::2])
    False
