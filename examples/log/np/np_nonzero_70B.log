I will provide you with the docstring for the nonzero function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nonzero. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the indices of the elements that are non-zero.

    Returns a tuple of arrays, one for each dimension of `a`,
    containing the indices of the non-zero elements in that
    dimension. The values in `a` are always tested and returned in
    row-major, C-style order.

    To group the indices by element, rather than dimension, use `argwhere`,
    which returns a row for each non-zero element.

    .. note::

       When called on a zero-d array or scalar, ``nonzero(a)`` is treated
       as ``nonzero(atleast_1d(a))``.

       .. deprecated:: 1.17.0

          Use `atleast_1d` explicitly if this behavior is deliberate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple_of_arrays : tuple
        Indices of elements that are non-zero.

    See Also
    --------
    flatnonzero :
        Return indices that are non-zero in the flattened version of the input
        array.
    ndarray.nonzero :
        Equivalent ndarray method.
    count_nonzero :
        Counts the number of non-zero elements in the input array.

    Notes
    -----
    While the nonzero values can be obtained with ``a[nonzero(a)]``, it is
    recommended to use ``x[x.astype(bool)]`` or ``x[x != 0]`` instead, which
    will correctly handle 0-d arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[3, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0], [5, 6, 0]])
    >>> x
    array([[3, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [5, 6, 0]])
    >>> np.nonzero(x)
    (array([0, 1, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 0, 1]))

    >>> x[np.nonzero(x)]
    array([3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.transpose(np.nonzero(x))
    array([[0, 0],
           [1, 1],
           [2, 0],
           [2, 1]])

    A common use for ``nonzero`` is to find the indices of an array, where
    a condition is True.  Given an array `a`, the condition `a` > 3 is a
    boolean array and since False is interpreted as 0, np.nonzero(a > 3)
    yields the indices of the `a` where the condition is true.

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> a > 3
    array([[False, False, False],
           [ True,  True,  True],
           [ True,  True,  True]])
    >>> np.nonzero(a > 3)
    (array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]))

    Using this result to index `a` is equivalent to using the mask directly:

    >>> a[np.nonzero(a > 3)]
    array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    >>> a[a > 3]  # prefer this spelling
    array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    ``nonzero`` can also be called as a method of the array.

    >>> (a > 3).nonzero()
    (array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]))

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[3, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0], [5, 6, 0]])
    >>> x
    array([[3, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [5, 6, 0]])
    >>> np.nonzero(x)
    (array([0, 1, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 0, 1]))

    >>> x[np.nonzero(x)]
    array([3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.transpose(np.nonzero(x))
    array([[0, 0],
           [1, 1],
           [2, 0],
           [2, 1]])

    A common use for ``nonzero`` is to find the indices of an array, where
    a condition is True.  Given an array `a`, the condition `a` > 3 is a
    boolean array and since False is interpreted as 0, np.nonzero(a > 3)
    yields the indices of the `a` where the condition is true.

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> a > 3
    array([[False, False, False],
           [ True,  True,  True],
           [ True,  True,  True]])
    >>> np.nonzero(a > 3)
    (array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]))

    Using this result to index `a` is equivalent to using the mask directly:

    >>> a[np.nonzero(a > 3)]
    array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    >>> a[a > 3]  # prefer this spelling
    array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    ``nonzero`` can also be called as a method of the array.

    >>> (a > 3).nonzero()
    (array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]))

    Non-zero elements in a 1-D array:

    >>> y = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 5, 0])
    >>> np.nonzero(y)
    (array([1, 2, 4, 5, 6]),)

I decided to add an example to show how `np.nonzero` works with a 1-D array, as the existing examples only demonstrate its use with 2-D arrays. This example helps to clarify the behavior of `np.nonzero` in a different context.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main use cases of `np.nonzero`, and the additional example provides further clarification on its behavior.
