I will provide you with the docstring for the dstack function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.dstack. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).

    This is equivalent to concatenation along the third axis after 2-D arrays
    of shape `(M,N)` have been reshaped to `(M,N,1)` and 1-D arrays of shape
    `(N,)` have been reshaped to `(1,N,1)`. Rebuilds arrays divided by
    `dsplit`.

    This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
    instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),
    and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` and
    `block` provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tup : sequence of arrays
        The arrays must have the same shape along all but the third axis.
        1-D or 2-D arrays must have the same shape.

    Returns
    -------
    stacked : ndarray
        The array formed by stacking the given arrays, will be at least 3-D.

    See Also
    --------
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
    stack : Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
    block : Assemble an nd-array from nested lists of blocks.
    vstack : Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise).
    hstack : Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).
    column_stack : Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
    dsplit : Split array along third axis.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array((1,2,3))
    >>> b = np.array((2,3,4))
    >>> np.dstack((a,b))
    array([[[1, 2],
            [2, 3],
            [3, 4]]])

    >>> a = np.array([[1],[2],[3]])
    >>> b = np.array([[2],[3],[4]])
    >>> np.dstack((a,b))
    array([[[1, 2]],
           [[2, 3]],
           [[3, 4]]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array((1,2,3))
    >>> b = np.array((2,3,4))
    >>> np.dstack((a,b))
    array([[[1, 2],
            [2, 3],
            [3, 4]]])

    >>> a = np.array([[1],[2],[3]])
    >>> b = np.array([[2],[3],[4]])
    >>> np.dstack((a,b))
    array([[[1, 2]],
           [[2, 3]],
           [[3, 4]]])

    Stacking 2D arrays:
    
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
    >>> b = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]])
    >>> np.dstack((a,b))
    array([[[[1, 2],
              [3, 4]]],
           [[[5, 6],
              [7, 8]]]])


I decided to add an example to demonstrate how `np.dstack` works with 2D arrays. This example shows that the function can be used to stack 2D arrays along the third axis, which can be useful for certain types of data, such as image data.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.dstack` with 1D and 2D arrays, and the new example provides additional insight into its behavior with 2D arrays. Adding more examples might be redundant and make the documentation too verbose.
