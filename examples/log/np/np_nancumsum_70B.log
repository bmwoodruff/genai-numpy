I will provide you with the docstring for the nancumsum function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.nancumsum. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the cumulative sum of array elements over a given axis treating Not a
    Numbers (NaNs) as zero.  The cumulative sum does not change when NaNs are
    encountered and leading NaNs are replaced by zeros.

    Zeros are returned for slices that are all-NaN or empty.

    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default
        (None) is to compute the cumsum over the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults
        to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with a
        precision less than that of the default platform integer.  In
        that case, the default platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type will be cast if necessary. See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for
        more details.

    Returns
    -------
    nancumsum : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which it is returned. The result has the same
        size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if `axis` is not None
        or `a` is a 1-d array.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.cumsum : Cumulative sum across array propagating NaNs.
    isnan : Show which elements are NaN.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.nancumsum(1)
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumsum([1])
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumsum([1, np.nan])
    array([1.,  1.])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nancumsum(a)
    array([1.,  3.,  6.,  6.])
    >>> np.nancumsum(a, axis=0)
    array([[1.,  2.],
           [4.,  2.]])
    >>> np.nancumsum(a, axis=1)
    array([[1.,  3.],
           [3.,  3.]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.nancumsum(1)
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumsum([1])
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumsum([1, np.nan])
    array([1.,  1.])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nancumsum(a)
    array([1.,  3.,  6.,  6.])
    >>> np.nancumsum(a, axis=0)
    array([[1.,  2.],
           [4.,  2.]])
    >>> np.nancumsum(a, axis=1)
    array([[1.,  3.],
           [3.,  3.]])

    Cumulative sum with dtype specified:
    
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, np.nan], dtype=np.float32)
    >>> np.nancumsum(a, dtype=np.float64)
    array([1.,  3.,  6.,  6.])

I decided to add this example because it demonstrates how to specify the `dtype` parameter to control the type of the returned array. This can be useful in certain situations where memory efficiency or specific numerical properties are important.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including different input types, axis specifications, and NaN handling. The additional example provides further insight into the function's behavior, but it's not necessary to add more examples at this point.
