I will provide you with the docstring for the require function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.require. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return an ndarray of the provided type that satisfies requirements.

    This function is useful to be sure that an array with the correct flags
    is returned for passing to compiled code (perhaps through ctypes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
       The object to be converted to a type-and-requirement-satisfying array.
    dtype : data-type
       The required data-type. If None preserve the current dtype. If your
       application requires the data to be in native byteorder, include
       a byteorder specification as a part of the dtype specification.
    requirements : str or sequence of str
       The requirements list can be any of the following

       * 'F_CONTIGUOUS' ('F') - ensure a Fortran-contiguous array
       * 'C_CONTIGUOUS' ('C') - ensure a C-contiguous array
       * 'ALIGNED' ('A')      - ensure a data-type aligned array
       * 'WRITEABLE' ('W')    - ensure a writable array
       * 'OWNDATA' ('O')      - ensure an array that owns its own data
       * 'ENSUREARRAY', ('E') - ensure a base array, instead of a subclass
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array with specified requirements and type if given.

    See Also
    --------
    asarray : Convert input to an ndarray.
    asanyarray : Convert to an ndarray, but pass through ndarray subclasses.
    ascontiguousarray : Convert input to a contiguous array.
    asfortranarray : Convert input to an ndarray with column-major
                     memory order.
    ndarray.flags : Information about the memory layout of the array.

    Notes
    -----
    The returned array will be guaranteed to have the listed requirements
    by making a copy if needed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3)
    >>> x.flags
      C_CONTIGUOUS : True
      F_CONTIGUOUS : False
      OWNDATA : False
      WRITEABLE : True
      ALIGNED : True
      WRITEBACKIFCOPY : False

    >>> y = np.require(x, dtype=np.float32, requirements=['A', 'O', 'W', 'F'])
    >>> y.flags
      C_CONTIGUOUS : False
      F_CONTIGUOUS : True
      OWNDATA : True
      WRITEABLE : True
      ALIGNED : True
      WRITEBACKIFCOPY : False

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:
