I will provide you with the docstring for the squeeze function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.squeeze. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Remove axes of length one from `a`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        Selects a subset of the entries of length one in the
        shape. If an axis is selected with shape entry greater than
        one, an error is raised.

    Returns
    -------
    squeezed : ndarray
        The input array, but with all or a subset of the
        dimensions of length 1 removed. This is always `a` itself
        or a view into `a`. Note that if all axes are squeezed,
        the result is a 0d array and not a scalar.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `axis` is not None, and an axis being squeezed is not of length 1

    See Also
    --------
    expand_dims : The inverse operation, adding entries of length one
    reshape : Insert, remove, and combine dimensions, and resize existing ones

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[[0], [1], [2]]])
    >>> x.shape
    (1, 3, 1)
    >>> np.squeeze(x).shape
    (3,)
    >>> np.squeeze(x, axis=0).shape
    (3, 1)
    >>> np.squeeze(x, axis=1).shape
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: cannot select an axis to squeeze out which has size
    not equal to one
    >>> np.squeeze(x, axis=2).shape
    (1, 3)
    >>> x = np.array([[1234]])
    >>> x.shape
    (1, 1)
    >>> np.squeeze(x)
    array(1234)  # 0d array
    >>> np.squeeze(x).shape
    ()
    >>> np.squeeze(x)[()]
    1234

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[[0], [1], [2]]])
    >>> x.shape
    (1, 3, 1)
    >>> np.squeeze(x).shape
    (3,)
    >>> np.squeeze(x, axis=0).shape
    (3, 1)
    >>> np.squeeze(x, axis=1).shape
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: cannot select an axis to squeeze out which has size
    not equal to one
    >>> np.squeeze(x, axis=2).shape
    (1, 3)
    >>> x = np.array([[1234]])
    >>> x.shape
    (1, 1)
    >>> np.squeeze(x)
    array(1234)  # 0d array
    >>> np.squeeze(x).shape
    ()
    >>> np.squeeze(x)[()]
    1234
    Squeezing a 3D array with multiple axes of length one:
    
    >>> y = np.array([[[[0], [1], [2]]]])
    >>> y.shape
    (1, 1, 3)
    >>> np.squeeze(y).shape
    (3,)

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only demonstrate squeezing a 3D array with a single axis of length one. This new example shows how `np.squeeze` behaves when there are multiple axes of length one in a 3D array. This can help users understand how the function handles more complex cases.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples, along with the new one, cover a good range of scenarios, including squeezing a 3D array with a single axis of length one, squeezing a 2D array, and squeezing a 3D array with multiple axes of length one. Additionally, the examples demonstrate the error handling when trying to squeeze an axis that is not of length one.
