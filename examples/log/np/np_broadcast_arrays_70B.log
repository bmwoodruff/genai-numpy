I will provide you with the docstring for the broadcast_arrays function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.broadcast_arrays. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Broadcast any number of arrays against each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *args : array_likes
        The arrays to broadcast.

    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
        the returned arrays will be forced to be a base-class array (default).

    Returns
    -------
    broadcasted : tuple of arrays
        These arrays are views on the original arrays.  They are typically
        not contiguous.  Furthermore, more than one element of a
        broadcasted array may refer to a single memory location. If you need
        to write to the arrays, make copies first. While you can set the
        ``writable`` flag True, writing to a single output value may end up
        changing more than one location in the output array.

        .. deprecated:: 1.17
            The output is currently marked so that if written to, a deprecation
            warning will be emitted. A future version will set the
            ``writable`` flag False so writing to it will raise an error.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3]])
    >>> y = np.array([[4],[5]])
    >>> np.broadcast_arrays(x, y)
    (array([[1, 2, 3],
            [1, 2, 3]]),
     array([[4, 4, 4],
            [5, 5, 5]]))

    Here is a useful idiom for getting contiguous copies instead of
    non-contiguous views.

    >>> [np.array(a) for a in np.broadcast_arrays(x, y)]
    [array([[1, 2, 3],
            [1, 2, 3]]),
     array([[4, 4, 4],
            [5, 5, 5]])]

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3]])
    >>> y = np.array([[4],[5]])
    >>> np.broadcast(x, y)
    (array([[1, 2, 3],
            [1, 2, 3]]),
     array([[4, 4, 4],
            [5, 5, 5]]))

    Here is a useful idiom for getting contiguous copies instead of
    non-contiguous views.

    >>> [np.array(a) for a in np.broadcast(x, y)]
    [array([[1, 2, 3],
            [1, 2, 3]]),
     array([[4, 4, 4],
            [5, 5, 5]])]

    Broadcasting multiple arrays:
    
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    >>> c = np.array([7, 8, 9])
    >>> np.broadcast(a, b, c)
    (array([1, 1, 1]),
     array([4, 5, 6]),
     array([7, 8, 9]))
