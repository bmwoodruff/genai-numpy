I will provide you with the docstring for the ix_ function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.ix_. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Construct an open mesh from multiple sequences.

    This function takes N 1-D sequences and returns N outputs with N
    dimensions each, such that the shape is 1 in all but one dimension
    and the dimension with the non-unit shape value cycles through all
    N dimensions.

    Using `ix_` one can quickly construct index arrays that will index
    the cross product. ``a[np.ix_([1,3],[2,5])]`` returns the array
    ``[[a[1,2] a[1,5]], [a[3,2] a[3,5]]]``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : 1-D sequences
        Each sequence should be of integer or boolean type.
        Boolean sequences will be interpreted as boolean masks for the
        corresponding dimension (equivalent to passing in
        ``np.nonzero(boolean_sequence)``).

    Returns
    -------
    out : tuple of ndarrays
        N arrays with N dimensions each, with N the number of input
        sequences. Together these arrays form an open mesh.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(10).reshape(2, 5)
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
           [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])
    >>> ixgrid = np.ix_([0, 1], [2, 4])
    >>> ixgrid
    (array([[0],
           [1]]), array([[2, 4]]))
    >>> ixgrid[0].shape, ixgrid[1].shape
    ((2, 1), (1, 2))
    >>> a[ixgrid]
    array([[2, 4],
           [7, 9]])

    >>> ixgrid = np.ix_([True, True], [2, 4])
    >>> a[ixgrid]
    array([[2, 4],
           [7, 9]])
    >>> ixgrid = np.ix_([True, True], [False, False, True, False, True])
    >>> a[ixgrid]
    array([[2, 4],
           [7, 9]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Construct an open mesh from multiple sequences.

    This function takes N 1-D sequences and returns N outputs with N
    dimensions each, such that the shape is 1 in all but one dimension
    and the dimension with the non-unit shape value cycles through all
    N dimensions.

    Using `ix_` one can quickly construct index arrays that will index
    the cross product. ``a[np.ix_([1,3],[2,5])]`` returns the array
    ``[[a[1,2] a[1,5]], [a[3,2] a[3,5]]]``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : 1-D sequences
        Each sequence should be of integer or boolean type.
        Boolean sequences will be interpreted as boolean masks for the
        corresponding dimension (equivalent to passing in
        ``np.nonzero(boolean_sequence)``).

    Returns
    -------
    out : tuple of ndarrays
        N arrays with N dimensions each, with N the number of input
        sequences. Together these arrays form an open mesh.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.arange(10).reshape(2, 5)
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
           [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])
    >>> ixgrid = np.ix_([0, 1], [2, 4])
    >>> ixgrid
    (array([[0],
           [1]]), array([[2, 4]]))
    >>> ixgrid[0].shape, ixgrid[1].shape
    ((2, 1), (1, 2))
    >>> a[ixgrid]
    array([[2, 4],
           [7, 9]])

    >>> ixgrid = np.ix_([True, True], [2, 4])
    >>> a[ixgrid]
    array([[2, 4],
           [7, 9]])
    >>> ixgrid = np.ix_([True, True], [False, False, True, False, True])
    >>> a[ixgrid]
    array([[2, 4],
           [7, 9]])

    Indexing a 3D array:
    
    >>> a = np.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
    >>> ixgrid = np.ix_([0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3])
    >>> a[ixgrid]
    array([[[ 1,  3],
            [[ 9, 11],
             [13, 15]]])

I decided to add this example because the existing examples only demonstrate indexing a 2D array, but `np.ix_` can be used to index arrays of any dimension. This new example shows how to use `np.ix_` to index a 3D array, which can help users understand how to apply this function to higher-dimensional arrays.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.ix_` with integer and boolean sequences, and the new example demonstrates its usage with higher-dimensional arrays. Adding more examples might make the documentation too verbose and repetitive, and might not provide significant additional value to users.
