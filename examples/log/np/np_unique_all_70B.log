I will provide you with the docstring for the unique_all function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.unique_all. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Find the unique elements of an array, and counts, inverse and indices.

    This function is an Array API compatible alternative to:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 1, 2])
    >>> np.unique(x, return_index=True, return_inverse=True,
    ...           return_counts=True, equal_nan=False)
    (array([1, 2]), array([0, 2]), array([0, 0, 1]), array([2, 1]))

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array. It will be flattened if it is not already 1-D.

    Returns
    -------
    out : namedtuple
        The result containing:

        * values - The unique elements of an input array.
        * indices - The first occurring indices for each unique element.
        * inverse_indices - The indices from the set of unique elements
          that reconstruct `x`.
        * counts - The corresponding counts for each unique element.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.unique_all([1, 1, 2])
    UniqueAllResult(values=array([1, 2]),
                    indices=array([0, 2]),
                    inverse_indices=array([0, 0, 1]),
                    counts=array([2, 1]))

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Find the unique elements of an array, and counts, inverse and indices.

    This function is an Array API compatible alternative to:

    >>> x = np.array([1, 1, 2])
    >>> np.unique(x, return_index=True, return_inverse=True,
    ...           return_counts=True, equal_nan=False)
    (array([1, 2]), array([0, 2]), array([0, 0, 1]), array([2, 1]))

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array. It will be flattened if it is not already 1-D.

    Returns
    -------
    out : namedtuple
        The result containing:

        * values - The unique elements of an input array.
        * indices - The first occurring indices for each unique element.
        * inverse_indices - The indices from the set of unique elements
          that reconstruct `x`.
        * counts - The corresponding counts for each unique element.

    unique : Find the unique elements of an array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.unique_all([1, 1, 2])
    UniqueAllResult(values=array([1, 2]),
                    indices=array([0, 2]),
                    inverse_indices=array([0, 0, 1]),
                    counts=array([2, 1]))

    Unique elements with NaN:
    
    >>> np.unique_all([1, 1, 2, float('nan')])
    UniqueAllResult(values=array([ 1.,  2., nan]),
                    indices=array([0, 2, 3]),
                    counts=array([2, 1, 1]),
                    inverse_indices=array([0, 0, 1, 2]))
