I will provide you with the docstring for the sinh function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.sinh. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

sinh(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Hyperbolic sine, element-wise.

Equivalent to ``1/2 * (np.exp(x) - np.exp(-x))`` or
``-1j * np.sin(1j*x)``.

Parameters
----------
x : array_like
    Input array.
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray
    The corresponding hyperbolic sine values.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

Notes
-----
If `out` is provided, the function writes the result into it,
and returns a reference to `out`.  (See Examples)

Examples
--------
>>> np.sinh(0)
0.0
>>> np.sinh(np.pi*1j/2)
1j
>>> np.sinh(np.pi*1j) # (exact value is 0)
1.2246063538223773e-016j
>>> # Discrepancy due to vagaries of floating point arithmetic.

>>> # Example of providing the optional output parameter
>>> out1 = np.array([0], dtype='d')
>>> out2 = np.sinh([0.1], out1)
>>> out2 is out1
True

>>> # Example of ValueError due to provision of shape mis-matched `out`
>>> np.sinh(np.zeros((3,3)),np.zeros((2,2)))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,3) (2,2)

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.sinh(0)
0.0
>>> np.sinh(np.pi*1j/2)
1j
>>> np.sinh(np.pi*1j) # (exact value is 0)
1.2246063538223773e-016j
>>> # Discrepancy due to vagaries of floating point arithmetic.

>>> # Example of providing the optional output parameter
>>> out1 = np.array([0], dtype='d')
>>> out2 = np.sinh([0.1], out1)
>>> out2 is out1
True

>>> # Example of ValueError due to provision of shape mis-matched `out`
>>> np.sinh(np.zeros((3,3)),np.zeros((2,2)))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,3) (2,2)

Using sinh with arrays:
>>> x = np.array([-np.pi, 0, np.pi])
>>> np.sinh(x)
[-11.54940923,  0.        , 11.54940923]

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how the `sinh` function works with arrays, as the existing examples only show scalar inputs. This example shows how the function can be used with an array of values, and how it returns an array of corresponding hyperbolic sine values.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including scalar inputs, complex inputs, providing an optional output parameter, and raising a `ValueError` when the output shape is mismatched. The additional example I added provides a new scenario, but further examples would likely be redundant or not add significant value to the documentation.
