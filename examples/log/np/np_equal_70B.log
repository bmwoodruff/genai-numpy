I will provide you with the docstring for the equal function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.equal. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

equal(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Return (x1 == x2) element-wise.

Parameters
----------
x1, x2 : array_like
    Input arrays.
    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
out : ndarray or scalar
    Output array, element-wise comparison of `x1` and `x2`.
    Typically of type bool, unless ``dtype=object`` is passed.
    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

See Also
--------
not_equal, greater_equal, less_equal, greater, less

Examples
--------
>>> np.equal([0, 1, 3], np.arange(3))
array([ True,  True, False])

What is compared are values, not types. So an int (1) and an array of
length one can evaluate as True:

>>> np.equal(1, np.ones(1))
array([ True])

The ``==`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.equal`` on
ndarrays.

>>> a = np.array([2, 4, 6])
>>> b = np.array([2, 4, 2])
>>> a == b
array([ True,  True, False])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

Examples
--------
>>> np.equal([0, 1, 3], np.arange(3))
array([ True,  True, False])

What is compared are values, not types. So an int (1) and an array of
length one can evaluate as True:

>>> np.equal(1, np.ones(1))
array([ True])

The ``==`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.equal`` on
ndarrays.

>>> a = np.array([2, 4, 6])
>>> b = np.array([2, 4, 2])
>>> a == b
array([ True,  True, False])

Comparing arrays with different dtypes:

>>> np.equal(np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=float), np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=int))
array([ True,  True, True])

I decided to add this example because it shows how `np.equal` behaves when comparing arrays with different dtypes. This is an important edge case that users should be aware of, as it may not be immediately intuitive how the function handles this situation.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.equal`, and the additional example I provided covers a specific edge case. Further examples would likely be redundant or cover very specific, niche use cases that are not essential to understanding the function's behavior.
