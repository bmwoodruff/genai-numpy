I will provide you with the docstring for the roll function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.roll. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Roll array elements along a given axis.

    Elements that roll beyond the last position are re-introduced at
    the first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    shift : int or tuple of ints
        The number of places by which elements are shifted.  If a tuple,
        then `axis` must be a tuple of the same size, and each of the
        given axes is shifted by the corresponding number.  If an int
        while `axis` is a tuple of ints, then the same value is used for
        all given axes.
    axis : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which elements are shifted.  By default, the
        array is flattened before shifting, after which the original
        shape is restored.

    Returns
    -------
    res : ndarray
        Output array, with the same shape as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    rollaxis : Roll the specified axis backwards, until it lies in a
               given position.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Supports rolling over multiple dimensions simultaneously.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(10)
    >>> np.roll(x, 2)
    array([8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
    >>> np.roll(x, -2)
    array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1])

    >>> x2 = np.reshape(x, (2, 5))
    >>> x2
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
           [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, 1)
    array([[9, 0, 1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, -1)
    array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8, 9, 0]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, 1, axis=0)
    array([[5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
           [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, -1, axis=0)
    array([[5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
           [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, 1, axis=1)
    array([[4, 0, 1, 2, 3],
           [9, 5, 6, 7, 8]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, -1, axis=1)
    array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 0],
           [6, 7, 8, 9, 5]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, (1, 1), axis=(1, 0))
    array([[9, 5, 6, 7, 8],
           [4, 0, 1, 2, 3]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, (2, 1), axis=(1, 0))
    array([[8, 9, 5, 6, 7],
           [3, 4, 0, 1, 2]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Roll array elements along a given axis.

    Elements that roll beyond the last position are re-introduced at
    the first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    shift : int or tuple of ints
        The number of places by which elements are shifted.  If a tuple,
        then `axis` must be a tuple of the same size, and each of the
        given axes is shifted by the corresponding number.  If an int
        while `axis` is a tuple of ints, then the same value is used for
        all given axes.
    axis : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which elements are shifted.  By default, the
        array is flattened before shifting, after which the original
        shape is restored.
