You are a helpful assistant working to improve the NumPy documentation. Use numpydoc style guidelines.

I will provide you with the docstring for the info function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.info. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Get help information for an array, function, class, or module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    object : object or str, optional
        Input object or name to get information about. If `object` is
        an `ndarray` instance, information about the array is printed.
        If `object` is a numpy object, its docstring is given. If it is
        a string, available modules are searched for matching objects.
        If None, information about `info` itself is returned.
    maxwidth : int, optional
        Printing width.
    output : file like object, optional
        File like object that the output is written to, default is
        ``None``, in which case ``sys.stdout`` will be used.
        The object has to be opened in 'w' or 'a' mode.
    toplevel : str, optional
        Start search at this level.

    Notes
    -----
    When used interactively with an object, ``np.info(obj)`` is equivalent
    to ``help(obj)`` on the Python prompt or ``obj?`` on the IPython
    prompt.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.info(np.polyval) # doctest: +SKIP
       polyval(p, x)
         Evaluate the polynomial p at x.
         ...

    When using a string for `object` it is possible to get multiple results.

    >>> np.info('fft') # doctest: +SKIP
         *** Found in numpy ***
    Core FFT routines
    ...
         *** Found in numpy.fft ***
     fft(a, n=None, axis=-1)
    ...
         *** Repeat reference found in numpy.fft.fftpack ***
         *** Total of 3 references found. ***

    When the argument is an array, information about the array is printed.

    >>> a = np.array([[1 + 2j, 3, -4], [-5j, 6, 0]], dtype=np.complex64)
    >>> np.info(a)
    class:  ndarray
    shape:  (2, 3)
    strides:  (24, 8)
    itemsize:  8
    aligned:  True
    contiguous:  True
    fortran:  False
    data pointer: 0x562b6e0d2860  # may vary
    byteorder:  little
    byteswap:  False
    type: complex64
