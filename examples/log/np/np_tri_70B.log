I will provide you with the docstring for the tri function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.tri. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    An array with ones at and below the given diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        Number of rows in the array.
    M : int, optional
        Number of columns in the array.
        By default, `M` is taken equal to `N`.
    k : int, optional
        The sub-diagonal at and below which the array is filled.
        `k` = 0 is the main diagonal, while `k` < 0 is below it,
        and `k` > 0 is above.  The default is 0.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data type of the returned array.  The default is float.
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    tri : ndarray of shape (N, M)
        Array with its lower triangle filled with ones and zero elsewhere;
        in other words ``T[i,j] == 1`` for ``j <= i + k``, 0 otherwise.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.tri(3, 5, 2, dtype=int)
    array([[1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])

    >>> np.tri(3, 5, -1)
    array([[0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [1.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    An array with ones at and below the given diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        Number of rows in the array.
    M : int, optional
        Number of columns in the array.
        By default, `M` is taken equal to `N`.
    k : int, optional
        The sub-diagonal at and below which the array is filled.
        `k` = 0 is the main diagonal, while `k` < 0 is below it,
        and `k` > 0 is above.  The default is 0.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data type of the returned array.  The default is float.
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    tri : ndarray of shape (N, M)
        Array with its lower triangle filled with ones and zero elsewhere;
        in other words ``T[i,j] == 1`` for ``j <= i + k``, 0 otherwise.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.tri(3, 5, 2, dtype=int)
    array([[1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])

    >>> np.tri(3, 5, -1)
    array([[0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [1.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])

    Default behavior:
    
    >>> np.tri(3)
    array([[1., 1., 1.],
           [1., 1., 1.],
           [1., 1., 1.]])
