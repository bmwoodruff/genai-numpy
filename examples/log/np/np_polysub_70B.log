I will provide you with the docstring for the polysub function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polysub. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Difference (subtraction) of two polynomials.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    Given two polynomials `a1` and `a2`, returns ``a1 - a2``.
    `a1` and `a2` can be either array_like sequences of the polynomials'
    coefficients (including coefficients equal to zero), or `poly1d` objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a1, a2 : array_like or poly1d
        Minuend and subtrahend polynomials, respectively.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or poly1d
        Array or `poly1d` object of the difference polynomial's coefficients.

    See Also
    --------
    polyval, polydiv, polymul, polyadd

    Examples
    --------
    .. math:: (2 x^2 + 10 x - 2) - (3 x^2 + 10 x -4) = (-x^2 + 2)

    >>> np.polysub([2, 10, -2], [3, 10, -4])
    array([-1,  0,  2])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    .. math:: (2 x^2 + 10 x - 2) - (3 x^2 + 10 x -4) = (-x^2 + 2)

    >>> np.polysub([2, 10, -2], [3, 10, -4])
    array([-1,  0,  2])

    Subtracting a polynomial from itself:

    >>> p = [2, 10, -2]
    >>> np.polysub(p, p)
    array([0, 0, 0])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the case where the minuend and subtrahend polynomials are the same. This is a common use case, and it's useful to show that the function correctly returns a polynomial with all coefficients equal to zero in this scenario.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing example already demonstrates the basic functionality of the `polysub` function, and the additional example I added covers a specific edge case. Further examples may not add significant value to the documentation, and may even make it more cluttered and harder to read.
