I will provide you with the docstring for the all function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.all. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Test whether all array elements along a given axis evaluate to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a logical AND reduction is performed.
        The default (``axis=None``) is to perform a logical AND over all
        the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.
        It must have the same shape as the expected output and its
        type is preserved (e.g., if ``dtype(out)`` is float, the result
        will consist of 0.0's and 1.0's). See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type`
        for more details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `all` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in checking for all `True` values.
        See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    all : ndarray, bool
        A new boolean or array is returned unless `out` is specified,
        in which case a reference to `out` is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.all : equivalent method

    any : Test whether any element along a given axis evaluates to True.

    Notes
    -----
    Not a Number (NaN), positive infinity and negative infinity
    evaluate to `True` because these are not equal to zero.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
       Before NumPy 2.0, ``all`` did not return booleans for object dtype
       input arrays.
       This behavior is still available via ``np.logical_and.reduce``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.all([[True,False],[True,True]])
    False

    >>> np.all([[True,False],[True,True]], axis=0)
    array([ True, False])

    >>> np.all([-1, 4, 5])
    True

    >>> np.all([1.0, np.nan])
    True

    >>> np.all([[True, True], [False, True]], where=[[True], [False]])
    True

    >>> o=np.array(False)
    >>> z=np.all([-1, 4, 5], out=o)
    >>> id(z), id(o), z
    (28293632, 28293632, array(True)) # may vary

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.all([[True,False],[True,True]])
    False

    >>> np.all([[True,False],[True,True]], axis=0)
    array([ True, False])

    >>> np.all([-1, 4, 5])
    True

    >>> np.all([1.0, np.nan])
    True

    >>> np.all([[True, True], [False, True]], where=[[True], [False]])
    True

    >>> o=np.array(False)
    >>> z=np.all([-1, 4, 5], out=o)
    >>> id(z), id(o), z
    (28293632, 28293632, array(True)) # may vary

    Using np.all with multiple axes:
    >>> np.all([[[True, True], [True, False]], [[True, True], [True, True]]], axis=(0, 1))
    array([False,  True])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of `np.all` with multiple axes, as this is a feature that was added in version 1.7.0 and is not explicitly shown in the existing examples. This example helps to clarify how `np.all` can be used to perform a logical AND reduction on multiple axes.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples, along with the new one I added, provide a comprehensive demonstration of the various ways `np.all` can be used, including with different input types, axes, and the `where` and `out` parameters.
