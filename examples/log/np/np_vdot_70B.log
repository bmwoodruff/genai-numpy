I will provide you with the docstring for the vdot function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.vdot. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    vdot(a, b, /)

    Return the dot product of two vectors.

    The vdot(`a`, `b`) function handles complex numbers differently than
    dot(`a`, `b`).  If the first argument is complex the complex conjugate
    of the first argument is used for the calculation of the dot product.

    Note that `vdot` handles multidimensional arrays differently than `dot`:
    it does *not* perform a matrix product, but flattens input arguments
    to 1-D vectors first. Consequently, it should only be used for vectors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        If `a` is complex the complex conjugate is taken before calculation
        of the dot product.
    b : array_like
        Second argument to the dot product.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        Dot product of `a` and `b`.  Can be an int, float, or
        complex depending on the types of `a` and `b`.

    See Also
    --------
    dot : Return the dot product without using the complex conjugate of the
          first argument.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1+2j,3+4j])
    >>> b = np.array([5+6j,7+8j])
    >>> np.vdot(a, b)
    (70-8j)
    >>> np.vdot(b, a)
    (70+8j)

    Note that higher-dimensional arrays are flattened!

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 4], [5, 6]])
    >>> b = np.array([[4, 1], [2, 2]])
    >>> np.vdot(a, b)
    30
    >>> np.vdot(b, a)
    30
    >>> 1*4 + 4*1 + 5*2 + 6*2
    30

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([1+2j,3+4j])
    >>> b = np.array([5+6j,7+8j])
    >>> np.vdot(a, b)
    (70-8j)
    >>> np.vdot(b, a)
    (70+8j)

    Note that higher-dimensional arrays are flattened!

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 4], [5, 6]])
    >>> b = np.array([[4, 1], [2, 2]])
    >>> np.vdot(a, b)
    30
    >>> np.vdot(b, a)
    30
    >>> 1*4 + 4*1 + 5*2 + 6*2
    30

    Real-valued vectors:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.vdot(a, b)
    32

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the behavior of `vdot` with real-valued vectors, as the existing examples only show complex-valued vectors. This additional example helps to illustrate that `vdot` works correctly with real-valued vectors as well.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the main aspects of `vdot` behavior, including complex-valued vectors and higher-dimensional arrays being flattened. The additional example provides further clarity, but it's not necessary to add more examples to demonstrate the function's behavior.
