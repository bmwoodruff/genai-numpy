I will provide you with the docstring for the arctan2 function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.arctan2. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

arctan2(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Element-wise arc tangent of ``x1/x2`` choosing the quadrant correctly.

The quadrant (i.e., branch) is chosen so that ``arctan2(x1, x2)`` is
the signed angle in radians between the ray ending at the origin and
passing through the point (1,0), and the ray ending at the origin and
passing through the point (`x2`, `x1`).  (Note the role reversal: the
"`y`-coordinate" is the first function parameter, the "`x`-coordinate"
is the second.)  By IEEE convention, this function is defined for
`x2` = +/-0 and for either or both of `x1` and `x2` = +/-inf (see
Notes for specific values).

This function is not defined for complex-valued arguments; for the
so-called argument of complex values, use `angle`.

Parameters
----------
x1 : array_like, real-valued
    `y`-coordinates.
x2 : array_like, real-valued
    `x`-coordinates.
    If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
    shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
angle : ndarray
    Array of angles in radians, in the range ``[-pi, pi]``.
    This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

--------
arctan, tan, angle

Notes
-----
*arctan2* is identical to the `atan2` function of the underlying
C library.  The following special values are defined in the C
standard: [1]_

====== ====== ================
`x1`   `x2`   `arctan2(x1,x2)`
====== ====== ================
+/- 0  +0     +/- 0
+/- 0  -0     +/- pi
 > 0   +/-inf +0 / +pi
 < 0   +/-inf -0 / -pi
+/-inf +inf   +/- (pi/4)
+/-inf -inf   +/- (3*pi/4)
====== ====== ================

Note that +0 and -0 are distinct floating point numbers, as are +inf
and -inf.

Examples
--------
Consider four points in different quadrants:

>>> x = np.array([-1, +1, +1, -1])
>>> y = np.array([-1, -1, +1, +1])
>>> np.arctan2(y, x) * 180 / np.pi
array([-135.,  -45.,   45.,  135.])

Note the order of the parameters. `arctan2` is defined also when `x2` = 0
and at several other special points, obtaining values in
the range ``[-pi, pi]``:

>>> np.arctan2([1., -1.], [0., 0.])
array([ 1.57079633, -1.57079633])
>>> np.arctan2([0., 0., np.inf], [+0., -0., np.inf])
array([0.        , 3.14159265, 0.78539816])

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
Consider four points in different quadrants:

>>> x = np.array([-1, +1, +1, -1])
>>> y = np.array([-1, -1, +1, +1])
>>> np.arctan2(y, x) * 180 / np.pi
array([-135.,  -45.,   45.,  135.])

Note the order of the parameters. `arctan2` is defined also when `x2` = 0
and at several other special points, obtaining values in
the range ``[-pi, pi]``:

>>> np.arctan2([1., -1.], [0., 0.])
array([ 1.57079633, -1.57079633])
>>> np.arctan2([0., 0., np.inf], [+0., -0., np.inf])
array([0.        , 3.14159265, 0.78539816])

Using arctan2 with negative infinity:

>>> np.arctan2([-np.inf, np.inf], [-np.inf, np.inf])
array([-2.35619449, 0.78539816])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the behavior of `arctan2` when both `x1` and `x2` are infinite, as this is an important edge case that may not be immediately obvious to users. This example helps to illustrate the IEEE convention mentioned in the docstring.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including different quadrants, special points, and edge cases. The additional example I provided helps to further illustrate the behavior of `arctan2` in a specific edge case, but it is not necessary to add more examples to fully understand the function's behavior.
