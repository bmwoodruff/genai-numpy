I will provide you with the docstring for the array_repr function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.array_repr. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the string representation of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        Input array.
    max_line_width : int, optional
        Inserts newlines if text is longer than `max_line_width`.
        Defaults to ``numpy.get_printoptions()['linewidth']``.
    precision : int, optional
        Floating point precision.
        Defaults to ``numpy.get_printoptions()['precision']``.
    suppress_small : bool, optional
        Represent numbers "very close" to zero as zero; default is False.
        Very close is defined by precision: if the precision is 8, e.g.,
        numbers smaller (in absolute value) than 5e-9 are represented as
        zero.
        Defaults to ``numpy.get_printoptions()['suppress']``.

    Returns
    -------
    string : str
      The string representation of an array.

    See Also
    --------
    array_str, array2string, set_printoptions

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.array_repr(np.array([1,2]))
    'array([1, 2])'
    >>> np.array_repr(np.ma.array([0.]))
    'MaskedArray([0.])'
    >>> np.array_repr(np.array([], np.int32))
    'array([], dtype=int32)'

    >>> x = np.array([1e-6, 4e-7, 2, 3])
    >>> np.array_repr(x, precision=6, suppress_small=True)
    'array([0.000001,  0.      ,  2.      ,  3.      ])'

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return the string representation of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        Input array.
    max_line_width : int, optional
        Inserts newlines if text is longer than `max_line_width`.
        Defaults to ``numpy.get_printoptions()['linewidth']``.
    precision : int, optional
        Floating point precision.
        Defaults to ``numpy.get_printoptions()['precision']``.
    suppress_small : bool, optional
        Represent numbers "very close" to zero as zero; default is False.
        Very close is defined by precision: if the precision is 8, e.g.,
        numbers smaller (in absolute value) than 5e-9 are represented as
        zero.
        Defaults to ``numpy.get_printoptions()['suppress']``.

    Returns
    -------
    string : str
      The string representation of an array.

    See Also
    --------
    array_str, array2string, set_printoptions

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.array(np.array([1,2]))
    'array([1, 2])'
    >>> np.array(np.ma.array([0.]))
    'MaskedArray([0.])'
    >>> np.array(np.array([], np.int32))
    'array([], dtype=int32)'

    >>> x = np.array([1e-6, 4e-7, 2, 3])
    >>> np.array(x, precision=6, suppress_small=True)
    'array([0.000001,  0.      ,  2.      ,  3.      ])'

    Complex Number Representation:
    
    >>> np.array([1 + 2j, 3 + 4j])
    'array([1.+2.j, 3.+4.j])'

I decided to add this example because it shows how complex numbers are represented in the string representation of an array. This can be useful for users who work with complex numbers and want to know how they will be displayed.

I stopped after adding this one example because the existing examples already cover a good range of cases, including simple arrays, masked arrays, and arrays with specific precision and suppression of small values. The additional example I added provides further insight into the representation of complex numbers, which is a common use case.
