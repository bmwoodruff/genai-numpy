I will provide you with the docstring for the logspace function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.logspace. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return numbers spaced evenly on a log scale.

    In linear space, the sequence starts at ``base ** start``
    (`base` to the power of `start`) and ends with ``base ** stop``
    (see `endpoint` below).

    .. versionchanged:: 1.16.0
        Non-scalar `start` and `stop` are now supported.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.25.0
        Non-scalar 'base` is now supported

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : array_like
        ``base ** start`` is the starting value of the sequence.
    stop : array_like
        ``base ** stop`` is the final value of the sequence, unless `endpoint`
        is False.  In that case, ``num + 1`` values are spaced over the
        interval in log-space, of which all but the last (a sequence of
        length `num`) are returned.
    num : integer, optional
        Number of samples to generate.  Default is 50.
    endpoint : boolean, optional
        If true, `stop` is the last sample. Otherwise, it is not included.
        Default is True.
    base : array_like, optional
        The base of the log space. The step size between the elements in
        ``ln(samples) / ln(base)`` (or ``log_base(samples)``) is uniform.
        Default is 10.0.
    dtype : dtype
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, the data type
        is inferred from `start` and `stop`. The inferred type will never be
        an integer; `float` is chosen even if the arguments would produce an
        array of integers.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis in the result to store the samples.  Relevant only if start,
        stop, or base are array-like.  By default (0), the samples will be
        along a new axis inserted at the beginning. Use -1 to get an axis at
        the end.

        .. versionadded:: 1.16.0


    Returns
    -------
    samples : ndarray
        `num` samples, equally spaced on a log scale.

    See Also
    --------
    arange : Similar to linspace, with the step size specified instead of the
             number of samples. Note that, when used with a float endpoint, the
             endpoint may or may not be included.
    linspace : Similar to logspace, but with the samples uniformly distributed
               in linear space, instead of log space.
    geomspace : Similar to logspace, but with endpoints specified directly.

    Notes
    -----
    If base is a scalar, logspace is equivalent to the code

    >>> y = np.linspace(start, stop, num=num, endpoint=endpoint)
    ... # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> power(base, y).astype(dtype)
    ... # doctest: +SKIP

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4)
    array([ 100.        ,  215.443469  ,  464.15888336, 1000.        ])
    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4, endpoint=False)
    array([100.        ,  177.827941  ,  316.22776602,  562.34132519])
    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4, base=2.0)
    array([4.        ,  5.0396842 ,  6.34960421,  8.        ])
    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4, base=[2.0, 3.0], axis=-1)
    array([[ 4.        ,  5.0396842 ,  6.34960421,  8.        ],
           [ 9.        , 12.98024613, 18.72075441, 27.        ]])

    Graphical illustration:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> N = 10
    >>> x1 = np.logspace(0.1, 1, N, endpoint=True)
    >>> x2 = np.logspace(0.1, 1, N, endpoint=False)
    >>> y = np.zeros(N)
    >>> plt.plot(x1, y, 'o')
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.plot(x2, y + 0.5, 'o')
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.ylim([-0.5, 1])
    (-0.5, 1)
    >>> plt.show()

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4)
    array([ 100.        ,  215.443469  ,  464.15888336, 1000.        ])
    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4, endpoint=False)
    array([100.        ,  177.827941  ,  316.22776602,  562.34132519])
    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4, base=2.0)
    array([4.        ,  5.0396842 ,  6.34960421,  8.        ])
    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4, base=[2.0, 3.0], axis=-1)
    array([[ 4.        ,  5.0396842 ,  6.34960421,  8.        ],
           [ 9.        , 12.98024613, 18.72075441, 27.        ]])

    Graphical illustration:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> N = 10
    >>> x1 = np.logspace(0.1, 1, N, endpoint=True)
    >>> x2 = np.logspace(0.1, 1, N, endpoint=False)
    >>> y = np.zeros(N)
    >>> plt.plot(x1, y, 'o')
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.plot(x2, y + 0.5, 'o')
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> plt.ylim([-0.5, 1])
    (-0.5, 1)
    >>> plt.show()

    Specifying dtype:

    >>> np.logspace(2.0, 3.0, num=4, dtype=int)
    array([100, 215, 464, 1000])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of the `dtype` parameter, which allows the user to specify the data type of the output array. This example shows how to use `dtype=int` to get an array of integers.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a good range of use cases, including different values of `start`, `stop`, `num`, `endpoint`, and `base`, as well as the use of array-like inputs for `base`. The additional example I added provides further clarity on the use of the `dtype` parameter.
