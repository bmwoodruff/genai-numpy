I will provide you with the docstring for the tril_indices function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.tril_indices. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return the indices for the lower-triangle of an (n, m) array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The row dimension of the arrays for which the returned
        indices will be valid.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal offset (see `tril` for details).
    m : int, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

        The column dimension of the arrays for which the returned
        arrays will be valid.
        By default `m` is taken equal to `n`.


    Returns
    -------
    inds : tuple of arrays
        The indices for the triangle. The returned tuple contains two arrays,
        each with the indices along one dimension of the array.

    See also
    --------
    triu_indices : similar function, for upper-triangular.
    mask_indices : generic function accepting an arbitrary mask function.
    tril, triu

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    Examples
    --------
    Compute two different sets of indices to access 4x4 arrays, one for the
    lower triangular part starting at the main diagonal, and one starting two
    diagonals further right:

    >>> il1 = np.tril_indices(4)
    >>> il2 = np.tril_indices(4, 2)

    Here is how they can be used with a sample array:

    >>> a = np.arange(16).reshape(4, 4)
    >>> a
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
           [12, 13, 14, 15]])

    Both for indexing:

    >>> a[il1]
    array([ 0,  4,  5, ..., 13, 14, 15])

    And for assigning values:

    >>> a[il1] = -1
    >>> a
    array([[-1,  1,  2,  3],
           [-1, -1,  6,  7],
           [-1, -1, -1, 11],
           [-1, -1, -1, -1]])

    These cover almost the whole array (two diagonals right of the main one):

    >>> a[il2] = -10
    >>> a
    array([[-10, -10, -10,   3],
           [-10, -10, -10, -10],
           [-10, -10, -10, -10],
           [-10, -10, -10, -10]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return the indices for the lower-triangle of an (n, m) array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The row dimension of the arrays for which the returned
        indices will be valid.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal offset (see `tril` for details).
    m : int, optional
        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

        The column dimension of the arrays for which the returned
        arrays will be valid.
        By default `m` is taken equal to `n`.


    Returns
    -------

           [-10, -10, -10, -10],
           [-10, -10, -10, -10])

    Using tril_indices with a non-square array:

    >>> rows, cols = np.tril_indices(3, 5)
    >>> a = np.zeros((3, 5))
    >>> a[rows, cols] = 1
    >>> a
    array([[1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [1., 1., 0., 0., 0.],
           [1., 1., 1., 0., 0.]])
