I will provide you with the docstring for the log function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.log. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

log(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Natural logarithm, element-wise.

The natural logarithm `log` is the inverse of the exponential function,
so that `log(exp(x)) = x`. The natural logarithm is logarithm in base
`e`.

Parameters
----------
x : array_like
    Input value.
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray
    The natural logarithm of `x`, element-wise.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

See Also
--------
log10, log2, log1p, emath.log

Notes
-----
Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite
number of `z` such that `exp(z) = x`. The convention is to return the
`z` whose imaginary part lies in `(-pi, pi]`.

For real-valued input data types, `log` always returns real output. For
each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it
yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

For complex-valued input, `log` is a complex analytical function that
has a branch cut `[-inf, 0]` and is continuous from above on it. `log`
handles the floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal negative
number, conforming to the C99 standard.

In the cases where the input has a negative real part and a very small
negative complex part (approaching 0), the result is so close to `-pi`
that it evaluates to exactly `-pi`.

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
>>> np.log([1, np.e, np.e**2, 0])
array([  0.,   1.,   2., -inf])

Logarithm of complex numbers:
>>> np.log(1 + 1j)
(0.34657359+0.78539816j)

I decided to add the second example because the original docstring only provided an example for real-valued input, but the function also works with complex-valued input. This additional example demonstrates the behavior of the function with complex numbers.

I stopped after adding one example because the original docstring already provided a comprehensive example that covers different cases (1, e, e^2, and 0), and the additional example I provided covers the complex-valued input case. Further examples might be redundant or not provide significant additional insight into the function's behavior.
