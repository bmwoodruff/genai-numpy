I will provide you with the docstring for the fix function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.fix. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Round to nearest integer towards zero.

    Round an array of floats element-wise to nearest integer towards zero.
    The rounded values are returned as floats.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        An array of floats to be rounded
    out : ndarray, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the input broadcasts to. If not provided or None, a
        freshly-allocated array is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray of floats
        A float array with the same dimensions as the input.
        If second argument is not supplied then a float array is returned
        with the rounded values.

        If a second argument is supplied the result is stored there.
        The return value `out` is then a reference to that array.

    See Also
    --------
    rint, trunc, floor, ceil
    around : Round to given number of decimals

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.fix(3.14)
    3.0
    >>> np.fix(3)
    3.0
    >>> np.fix([2.1, 2.9, -2.1, -2.9])
    array([ 2.,  2., -2., -2.])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    out : ndarray of floats
        A float array with the same dimensions as the input.
