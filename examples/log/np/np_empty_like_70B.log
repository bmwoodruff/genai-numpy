I will provide you with the docstring for the empty_like function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.empty_like. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    empty_like(prototype, dtype=None, order='K', subok=True, shape=None, *,
               device=None)

    Return a new array with the same shape and type as a given array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prototype : array_like
        The shape and data-type of `prototype` define these same attributes
        of the returned array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Overrides the data type of the result.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', or 'K'}, optional
        Overrides the memory layout of the result. 'C' means C-order,
        'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if `prototype` is Fortran
        contiguous, 'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout of `prototype`
        as closely as possible.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
    subok : bool, optional.
        If True, then the newly created array will use the sub-class
        type of `prototype`, otherwise it will be a base-class array. Defaults
        to True.
    shape : int or sequence of ints, optional.
        Overrides the shape of the result. If order='K' and the number of
        dimensions is unchanged, will try to keep order, otherwise,
        order='C' is implied.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17.0
    device : str, optional
        The device on which to place the created array. Default: None.
        For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``"cpu"`` if passed.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of uninitialized (arbitrary) data with the same
        shape and type as `prototype`.

    See Also
    --------
    ones_like : Return an array of ones with shape and type of input.
    zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
    full_like : Return a new array with shape of input filled with value.
    empty : Return a new uninitialized array.

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike other array creation functions (e.g. `zeros_like`, `ones_like`,
    `full_like`), `empty_like` does not initialize the values of the array,
    and may therefore be marginally faster. However, the values stored in the
    newly allocated array are arbitrary. For reproducible behavior, be sure
    to set each element of the array before reading.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = ([1,2,3], [4,5,6])                         # a is array-like
    >>> np.empty_like(a)
    array([[-1073741821, -1073741821,           3],    # uninitialized
           [          0,           0, -1073741821]])
    >>> a = np.array([[1., 2., 3.],[4.,5.,6.]])
    >>> np.empty_like(a)
    array([[ -2.00000715e+000,   1.48219694e-323,  -2.00000572e+000], # uninit
           [  4.38791518e-305,  -2.00000715e+000,   4.17269252e-309]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = ([1,2,3], [4,5,6])                         # a is array-like
    >>> np.empty_like(a)
    array([[-1073741821, -1073741821,           3],    # uninitialized
           [          0,           0, -1073741821]])
    >>> a = np.array([[1., 2., 3.],[4.,5.,6.]])
    >>> np.empty_like(a)
    array([[ -2.00000715e+000,   1.48219694e-323,  -2.00000572e+000], # uninit
           [  4.38791518e-305,  -2.00000715e+000,   4.17269252e-309]])

    Specifying the dtype:
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4,5,6]])
    >>> np.empty_like(a, dtype=np.float64)
    array([[ 7.05581155e-310,  1.48219694e-323,  7.05581155e-310], # uninit
           [ 4.38791518e-305,  7.05581155e-310,  4.17269252e-309]])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how the `dtype` parameter can be used to specify the data type of the resulting array. This is an important feature of the `empty_like` function, and the existing examples do not illustrate this.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already demonstrate the basic usage of the `empty_like` function, and the new example provides additional information about how to customize the resulting array. Adding more examples would likely be redundant or unnecessary.
