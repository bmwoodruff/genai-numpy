I will provide you with the docstring for the arange function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.arange. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None, *, device=None, like=None)

    Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.

    ``arange`` can be called with a varying number of positional arguments:

    * ``arange(stop)``: Values are generated within the half-open interval
      ``[0, stop)`` (in other words, the interval including `start` but
      excluding `stop`).
    * ``arange(start, stop)``: Values are generated within the half-open
      interval ``[start, stop)``.
    * ``arange(start, stop, step)`` Values are generated within the half-open
      interval ``[start, stop)``, with spacing between values given by
      ``step``.

    For integer arguments the function is roughly equivalent to the Python
    built-in :py:class:`range`, but returns an ndarray rather than a ``range``
    instance.

    When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, it is often better to use
    `numpy.linspace`.

    See the Warning sections below for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : integer or real, optional
        Start of interval.  The interval includes this value.  The default
        start value is 0.
    stop : integer or real
        End of interval.  The interval does not include this value, except
        in some cases where `step` is not an integer and floating point
        round-off affects the length of `out`.
    step : integer or real, optional
        Spacing between values.  For any output `out`, this is the distance
        between two adjacent values, ``out[i+1] - out[i]``.  The default
        step size is 1.  If `step` is specified as a position argument,
        `start` must also be given.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
        type from the other input arguments.
    device : str, optional
        The device on which to place the created array. Default: None.
        For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``"cpu"`` if passed.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0
    like : array_like, optional
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not
        NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports
        the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined
        by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object
        compatible with that passed in via this argument.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    arange : ndarray
        Array of evenly spaced values.

        For floating point arguments, the length of the result is
        ``ceil((stop - start)/step)``.  Because of floating point overflow,
        this rule may result in the last element of `out` being greater
        than `stop`.

    Warnings
    --------
    The length of the output might not be numerically stable.

    Another stability issue is due to the internal implementation of
    `numpy.arange`.
    The actual step value used to populate the array is
    ``dtype(start + step) - dtype(start)`` and not `step`. Precision loss
    can occur here, due to casting or due to using floating points when
    `start` is much larger than `step`. This can lead to unexpected
    behaviour. For example::

      >>> np.arange(0, 5, 0.5, dtype=int)
      array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
      >>> np.arange(-3, 3, 0.5, dtype=int)
      array([-3, -2, -1,  0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8])

    In such cases, the use of `numpy.linspace` should be preferred.

    The built-in :py:class:`range` generates :std:doc:`Python built-in integers
    that have arbitrary size <python:c-api/long>`, while `numpy.arange`
    produces `numpy.int32` or `numpy.int64` numbers. This may result in
    incorrect results for large integer values::

      >>> power = 40
      >>> modulo = 10000
      >>> x1 = [(n ** power) % modulo for n in range(8)]
      >>> x2 = [(n ** power) % modulo for n in np.arange(8)]
      >>> print(x1)
      [0, 1, 7776, 8801, 6176, 625, 6576, 4001]  # correct
      >>> print(x2)
      [0, 1, 7776, 7185, 0, 5969, 4816, 3361]  # incorrect

    Examples

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.arange(3)
    array([0, 1, 2])
    >>> np.arange(3.0)
    array([ 0.,  1.,  2.])
    >>> np.arange(3,7)
    array([3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.arange(3,7,2)
    array([3, 5])
    Using arange with a non-integer step:
    
    >>> np.arange(0, 1, 0.1)
    array([ 0. ,  0.1,  0.2,  0.3,  0.4,  0.5,  0.6,  0.7,  0.8,  0.9])

I decided to add an example to demonstrate the use of `arange` with a non-integer step, as this is a common use case and the warning sections mention that it's often better to use `linspace` in such cases. This example shows how `arange` can be used to generate an array of evenly spaced values with a non-integer step.

I stopped after adding one example because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `arange` with different numbers of positional arguments, and the new example provides additional information about using `arange` with a non-integer step.
