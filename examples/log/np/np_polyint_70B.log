I will provide you with the docstring for the polyint function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polyint. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return an antiderivative (indefinite integral) of a polynomial.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    The returned order `m` antiderivative `P` of polynomial `p` satisfies
    :math:`\frac{d^m}{dx^m}P(x) = p(x)` and is defined up to `m - 1`
    integration constants `k`. The constants determine the low-order
    polynomial part

    .. math:: \frac{k_{m-1}}{0} x^0 + \ldots + \frac{k_0}{(m-1)!}x^{m-1}

    of `P` so that :math:`P^{(j)}(0) = k_{m-j-1}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : array_like or poly1d
        Polynomial to integrate.
        A sequence is interpreted as polynomial coefficients, see `poly1d`.
    m : int, optional
        Order of the antiderivative. (Default: 1)
    k : list of `m` scalars or scalar, optional
        Integration constants. They are given in the order of integration:
        those corresponding to highest-order terms come first.

        If ``None`` (default), all constants are assumed to be zero.
        If `m = 1`, a single scalar can be given instead of a list.

    --------
    polyder : derivative of a polynomial
    poly1d.integ : equivalent method

    Examples
    --------
    The defining property of the antiderivative:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1,1,1])
    >>> P = np.polyint(p)
    >>> P
     poly1d([ 0.33333333,  0.5       ,  1.        ,  0.        ]) # may vary
    >>> np.polyder(P) == p
    True

    The integration constants default to zero, but can be specified:

    >>> P = np.polyint(p, 3)
    >>> P(0)
    0.0
    >>> np.polyder(P)(0)
    0.0
    >>> np.polyder(P, 2)(0)
    0.0
    >>> P = np.polyint(p, 3, k=[6,5,3])
    >>> P
    poly1d([ 0.01666667,  0.04166667,  0.16666667,  3. ,  5. ,  3. ]) # may vary

    Note that 3 = 6 / 2!, and that the constants are given in the order of
    integrations. Constant of the highest-order polynomial term comes first:

    >>> np.polyder(P, 2)(0)
    6.0
    >>> np.polyder(P, 1)(0)
    5.0
    >>> P(0)
    3.0

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Examples
    --------
    The defining property of the antiderivative:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1,1,1])
    >>> P = np.polyint(p)
    >>> P
     poly1d([ 0.33333333,  0.5       ,  1.        ,  0.        ]) # may vary
    >>> np.polyder(P) == p
    True

    The integration constants default to zero, but can be specified:

    >>> P = np.polyint(p, 3)
    >>> P(0)
    0.0
    >>> np.polyder(P)(0)
    0.0
    >>> np.polyder(P, 2)(0)
    0.0
    >>> P = np.polyint(p, 3, k=[6,5,3])
    >>> P
    poly1d([ 0.01666667,  0.04166667,  0.16666667,  3. ,  5. ,  3. ]) # may vary

    Note that 3 = 6 / 2!, and that the constants are given in the order of
    integrations. Constant of the highest-order polynomial term comes first:

    >>> np.polyder(P, 2)(0)
    6.0
    >>> np.polyder(P, 1)(0)
    5.0
    >>> P(0)
    3.0

    Single-term polynomial integration:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([2])
    >>> P = np.polyint(p)
    >>> P
    poly1d([ 1.,  0.]) # may vary
    >>> np.polyder(P) == p
    True
