You are a helpful assistant working to improve the NumPy documentation. Use numpydoc style guidelines.

I will provide you with the docstring for the isin function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.isin. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Calculates ``element in test_elements``, broadcasting over `element` only.
    Returns a boolean array of the same shape as `element` that is True
    where an element of `element` is in `test_elements` and False otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    element : array_like
        Input array.
    test_elements : array_like
        The values against which to test each value of `element`.
        This argument is flattened if it is an array or array_like.
        See notes for behavior with non-array-like parameters.
    assume_unique : bool, optional
        If True, the input arrays are both assumed to be unique, which
        can speed up the calculation.  Default is False.
    invert : bool, optional
        If True, the values in the returned array are inverted, as if
        calculating `element not in test_elements`. Default is False.
        ``np.isin(a, b, invert=True)`` is equivalent to (but faster
        than) ``np.invert(np.isin(a, b))``.
    kind : {None, 'sort', 'table'}, optional
        The algorithm to use. This will not affect the final result,
        but will affect the speed and memory use. The default, None,
        will select automatically based on memory considerations.

        * If 'sort', will use a mergesort-based approach. This will have
          a memory usage of roughly 6 times the sum of the sizes of
          `element` and `test_elements`, not accounting for size of dtypes.
        * If 'table', will use a lookup table approach similar
          to a counting sort. This is only available for boolean and
          integer arrays. This will have a memory usage of the
          size of `element` plus the max-min value of `test_elements`.
          `assume_unique` has no effect when the 'table' option is used.
        * If None, will automatically choose 'table' if
          the required memory allocation is less than or equal to
          6 times the sum of the sizes of `element` and `test_elements`,
          otherwise will use 'sort'. This is done to not use
          a large amount of memory by default, even though
          'table' may be faster in most cases. If 'table' is chosen,
          `assume_unique` will have no effect.


    Returns
    -------
    isin : ndarray, bool
        Has the same shape as `element`. The values `element[isin]`
        are in `test_elements`.

    Notes
    -----

    `isin` is an element-wise function version of the python keyword `in`.
    ``isin(a, b)`` is roughly equivalent to
    ``np.array([item in b for item in a])`` if `a` and `b` are 1-D sequences.

    `element` and `test_elements` are converted to arrays if they are not
    already. If `test_elements` is a set (or other non-sequence collection)
    it will be converted to an object array with one element, rather than an
    array of the values contained in `test_elements`. This is a consequence
    of the `array` constructor's way of handling non-sequence collections.
    Converting the set to a list usually gives the desired behavior.

    Using ``kind='table'`` tends to be faster than `kind='sort'` if the
    following relationship is true:
    ``log10(len(test_elements)) >
    (log10(max(test_elements)-min(test_elements)) - 2.27) / 0.927``,
    but may use greater memory. The default value for `kind` will
    be automatically selected based only on memory usage, so one may
    manually set ``kind='table'`` if memory constraints can be relaxed.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13.0

    Examples
    --------
    >>> element = 2*np.arange(4).reshape((2, 2))
    >>> element
    array([[0, 2],
           [4, 6]])
    >>> test_elements = [1, 2, 4, 8]
    >>> mask = np.isin(element, test_elements)
    >>> mask
    array([[False,  True],
           [ True, False]])
    >>> element[mask]
    array([2, 4])

    The indices of the matched values can be obtained with `nonzero`:

    >>> np.nonzero(mask)
    (array([0, 1]), array([1, 0]))

    The test can also be inverted:

    >>> mask = np.isin(element, test_elements, invert=True)
    >>> mask
    array([[ True, False],
           [False,  True]])
    >>> element[mask]
    array([0, 6])

    Because of how `array` handles sets, the following does not
    work as expected:

    >>> test_set = {1, 2, 4, 8}
    >>> np.isin(element, test_set)
    array([[False, False],
           [False, False]])

    Casting the set to a list gives the expected result:

    >>> np.isin(element, list(test_set))
    array([[False,  True],
           [ True, False]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Calculates ``element in test_elements``, broadcasting over `element` only.
    Returns a boolean array of the same shape as `element` that is True
    where an element of `element` is in `test_elements` and False otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    element : array_like
        Input array.
    test_elements : array_like
        The values against which to test each value of `element`.
        This argument is flattened if it is an array or array_like.
        See notes for behavior with non-array-like parameters.
    assume_unique : bool, optional
        If True, the input arrays are both assumed to be unique, which
        can speed up the calculation.  Default is False.
    invert : bool, optional
        If True, the values in the returned array are inverted, as if
        calculating `element not in test_elements`. Default is False.
        ``np.isin(a, b, invert=True)`` is equivalent to (but faster
        than) ``np.invert(np.isin(a, b))``.
    kind : {None, 'sort', 'table'}, optional
        The algorithm to use. This will not affect the final result,
        but will affect the speed and memory use. The default, None,
        will select automatically based on memory considerations.

        * If 'sort', will use a mergesort-based approach. This will have

          'table' may be faster in most cases. If 'table' is chosen,
          `assume_unique` will have no effect.
