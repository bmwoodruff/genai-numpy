I will provide you with the docstring for the isnat function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.isnat. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.

isnat(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature])

Test element-wise for NaT (not a time) and return result as a boolean array.

.. versionadded:: 1.13.0

Parameters
----------
x : array_like
    Input array with datetime or timedelta data type.
out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
    A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
    a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
    a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
    keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
where : array_like, optional
    This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
    condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
    Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
    Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
    ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
    remain uninitialized.
**kwargs
    For other keyword-only arguments, see the
    :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray or bool
    True where ``x`` is NaT, false otherwise.
    This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

Examples
--------
>>> np.isnat(np.datetime64("NaT"))
True
>>> np.isnat(np.datetime64("2016-01-01"))
False
>>> np.isnat(np.array(["NaT", "2016-01-01"], dtype="datetime64[ns]"))
array([ True, False])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

Examples
--------
>>> np.isnat(np.datetime64("NaT"))
True
>>> np.isnat(np.datetime64("2016-01-01"))
False
>>> np.isnat(np.array(["NaT", "2016-01-01"], dtype="datetime64[ns]"))
array([ True, False])
Mixing NaT with other datetime64 values:
 
>>> x = np.array(["NaT", "2016-01-01", "2017-01-01"], dtype="datetime64[ns]")
>>> y = np.array(["2016-01-01", "2017-01-01", "NaT"], dtype="datetime64[ns]")
>>> np.isnat(np.concatenate((x, y)))
array([ True, False, False, False, False, True])

I decided to add an example that demonstrates the use of `np.isnat` with an array that contains a mix of NaT and other datetime64 values. This example shows how `np.isnat` can be used to identify NaT values in a larger array.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover the basic usage of `np.isnat` with scalar and array inputs, and the additional example I added demonstrates a more complex use case. Further examples would likely be redundant or too specific to be useful for most users.
