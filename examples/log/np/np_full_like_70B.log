You are a helpful assistant working to improve the NumPy documentation. Use numpydoc style guidelines.

I will provide you with the docstring for the full_like function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.full_like. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Return a full array with the same shape and type as a given array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The shape and data-type of `a` define these same attributes of
        the returned array.
    fill_value : array_like
        Fill value.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Overrides the data type of the result.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', or 'K'}, optional
        Overrides the memory layout of the result. 'C' means C-order,
        'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if `a` is Fortran contiguous,
        'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout of `a` as closely
        as possible.
    subok : bool, optional.
        If True, then the newly created array will use the sub-class
        type of `a`, otherwise it will be a base-class array. Defaults
        to True.
    shape : int or sequence of ints, optional.
        Overrides the shape of the result. If order='K' and the number of
        dimensions is unchanged, will try to keep order, otherwise,
        order='C' is implied.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17.0
    device : str, optional
        The device on which to place the created array. Default: None.
        For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``"cpu"`` if passed.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of `fill_value` with the same shape and type as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    empty_like : Return an empty array with shape and type of input.
    ones_like : Return an array of ones with shape and type of input.
    zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
    full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6, dtype=int)
    >>> np.full_like(x, 1)
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
    >>> np.full_like(x, 0.1)
    array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    >>> np.full_like(x, 0.1, dtype=np.double)
    array([0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1])
    >>> np.full_like(x, np.nan, dtype=np.double)
    array([nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan])

    >>> y = np.arange(6, dtype=np.double)
    >>> np.full_like(y, 0.1)
    array([0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1])

    >>> y = np.zeros([2, 2, 3], dtype=int)
    >>> np.full_like(y, [0, 0, 255])
    array([[[  0,   0, 255],
            [  0,   0, 255]],
           [[  0,   0, 255],
            [  0,   0, 255]]])

Here is the updated docstring with an additional example:

    Return a full array with the same shape and type as a given array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The shape and data-type of `a` define these same attributes of
        the returned array.
    fill_value : array_like
        Fill value.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Overrides the data type of the result.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', or 'K'}, optional
        Overrides the memory layout of the result. 'C' means C-order,
        'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if `a` is Fortran contiguous,
        'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout of `a` as closely
        as possible.
    subok : bool, optional.
        If True, then the newly created array will use the sub-class
        type of `a`, otherwise it will be a base-class array. Defaults
        to True.
    shape : int or sequence of ints, optional.
        Overrides the shape of the result. If order='K' and the number of
        dimensions is unchanged, will try to keep order, otherwise,
        order='C' is implied.

        .. versionadded:: 1.17.0
    device : str, optional
        The device on which to place the created array. Default: None.
        For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``"cpu"`` if passed.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array of `fill_value` with the same shape and type as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    empty_like : Return an empty array with shape and type of input.
    ones_like : Return an array of ones with shape and type of input.
    zeros_like : Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.
    full : Return a new array of given shape filled with value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(6, dtype=int)
    >>> np.full_like(x, 1)
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
    >>> np.full_like(x, 0.1)
    array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    >>> np.full_like(x, 0.1, dtype=np.double)
    array([0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1])
    >>> np.full_like(x, np.nan, dtype=np.double)
    array([nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan])

    >>> y = np.arange(6, dtype=np.double)
    >>> np.full_like(y, 0.1)
    array([0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1])

    >>> y = np.zeros([2, 2, 3], dtype=int)
    >>> np.full_like(y, [0, 0, 255])
    array([[[  0,   0, 255],
            [  0,   0, 255]],
           [[  0,   0, 255],
            [  0,   0, 255]]])

    Using the device parameter:
    >>> x = np.arange(6, dtype=int)
    >>> np.full_like(x, 1, device="cpu")
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

I decided to add an example that demonstrates the use of the `device` parameter, which was added in version 2.0.0. This example shows how to create an array on a specific device using the `full_like` function.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover various scenarios, such as different data types, shapes, and fill values. The additional example I added provides a clear demonstration of the `device` parameter, which is a new feature.
